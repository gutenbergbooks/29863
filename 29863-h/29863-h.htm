<p><span class = "firstword">Let</span> not my readers suppose that in
writing <span class = "smallcaps">The Rambles of a Rat</span> I have
simply been blowing bubbles of fancy for their amusement, to divert them
during an idle hour. Like the hollow glass balls which children delight
in, my bubbles of fancy have something solid within them,&mdash;facts
are enclosed in my fiction. I have indeed made rats talk, feel, and
reflect, as those little creatures certainly never did; but the courage,
presence of mind, fidelity, and kindness, which I have attributed to my
heroes, have been shown by real rats. Such adventures as I have
described have actually happened to them, unless they be those recorded
in the 19th chapter, for which I have no authority. For my anecdotes of
this much-despised race I am principally indebted to an interesting
article
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
on the subject which appeared in the “Quarterly Review.”</p>

<p>I would suggest to my readers how wide and delightful a field of
knowledge natural history must open to all, when there is so much to
interest and admire even in those animals which we usually regard with
contempt and disgust. The examination of the wondrous works of nature is
a study elevating as well as delightful; for the more deeply we search
into the wonders around us, the more clearly we discover the wisdom
which is displayed even in the lowest forms of creation!</p>

CHAPTER I.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">THE FAMILY OF RATS.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">My</span> very earliest recollection is of
running about in a shed adjoining a large warehouse, somewhere in the
neighbourhood of Poplar, and close to the River Thames, which
thereabouts is certainly no silver stream.</p>

<p>A merry life we led of it in that shed, my seven brothers and&nbsp;I!
It was a sort of palace of rubbish, a mansion of odds and ends, where
rats might frolic and gambol, and play at hide-and-seek, to their
hearts’ content. We had nibbled a nice little way into the warehouse
above mentioned; and there, every night, we feasted at our ease, growing
as sleek and plump as any rats in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>We were of an ancient race of British
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
rats, my seven brothers and&nbsp;I. It is said that our ancestors came
over with the Conqueror, William; and we are not a little proud of our
Norman descent. Our smaller forms, sleek black coats, long tails, and
fine large ears, make us altogether distinct from the Norwegian brown
rat, on which we look with&mdash;I was going to say with contempt, but I
rather think that it is quite another feeling, and one to which neither
rats nor men generally like to plead guilty. I know that we do not
usually choose to keep company with them; but whether it be because
their forms are coarser, their manners less refined, and their pedigree
not so long, or whether it be because they sometimes have a fancy to
nibble off the ears of their neighbours, or, when their appetite is
uncommonly sharp, make a meal of their Norman cousins, we need not
particularly inquire.</p>

<p>I said that I and my seven brothers were black rats; but I ought to
make one exception. The youngest of the family was piebald&mdash;a
curious peculiarity, which I never noticed in any other of our race.
Yes, he was piebald; and not only had he this misfortune,
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
but he was the clumsiest and most ill-shaped rat that ever nibbled a
candle-end! Now, this was no fault of his, and certainly was no reason
why he should have been despised by his more fortunate brothers. Man, of
course, as a superior creature, would only look with kindness and pity
upon a companion so unhappy as to have personal defects. He would never
ridicule a condition which might have been his own, nor find a subject
for merriment in that which to another was a cause of annoyance; but we
were only inconsiderate young rats, and there was no end to our jokes on
our piebald comrade. “Oddity,” “Guinea-pig,” “Old Spotty,” and
“Frightful”&mdash;such were the names which we gave him. The first was
that by which he was best known, and the only one to which he chose to
answer. But he was a good-humoured fellow, poor Oddity, and bore our
rudeness with patience and temper. He pursued the plan which I would
recommend to all rats in his position: he joined the mirth which his own
appearance raised; and when we made merry at the awkward manner in which
he waddled after his more light-footed companions, he never took
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
it amiss, nor retired into a corner of the shed to sulk, amidst
rope-ends and bits of rusty iron.</p>

<p>I have said that we had merry nights in the warehouse. Often has the
moon looked in through the dull, many-paned windows, lighting our
revels; though we cared little for light, our delicate feelers almost
supplying the place of eyes. But one night above all nights I
remember!</p>

<p>There had been a great deal of moving about in the warehouse during
the day, running of trucks, and rolling of casks. Brisk, the liveliest
of my brothers, had sat watching in a hole from noon until dusk, and now
hurried through our little passage into the shed, where we were all
nestling behind some old canvass. He brought us news of a coming
feast.</p>

<p>“A ship has arrived from India,” said he, “and we’ll have a glance at
the cargo. They’ve been busy stowing it away next door. There’s
rice&mdash;”</p>

<p>The brotherhood of rats whisked their tails for joy!</p>

<p>“Sugar&mdash;”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<p>There was a universal squeak of approbation.</p>

<p>“Indigo&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing but a blue dye obtained from a plant,” observed
Furry, an old, blind rat, who in his days had travelled far, and seen
much of the world, and had reflected upon what he had viewed far more
than is common with a rat. Indeed, he passed amongst us for a
philosopher, and I had learnt not a little from his experience; for he
delighted in talking over his travels, and but for a little testiness of
temper, would have been a very agreeable companion. He very frequently
joined our party; indeed, his infirmities obliged him to do so, as he
could not have lived without assistance. But I must now return to Brisk,
and his catalogue of the cargo.</p>

<p>“Opium&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The juice of the white poppy,” said our aged friend, who had a taste
for general information. “I’ve seen it produce strange effects when
eaten in large quantities by men.”</p>

<p>“What effects?” said I. I was a very inquisitive rat, and especially
curious about all
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
that related to the large creatures upon two legs, called Man, whom I
believed to be as much wiser as they are stronger than the race of Mus,
to which I belong.</p>

<p>“Why, opium makes men first wild and bold, so that they will rush
into danger or run into folly, quarrel with their friends and fight
their foes, laugh and dance, and be merry they know not why. Then they
grow sleepy, and though their lives might depend on it, not a step would
they stir. Then, when they awake from their unnatural sleep, their
bodies are cold, their heads heavy; they feel sick, and faint, and sad!
And if this should happen day after day, at last the strong grows weak
and the healthy ill, the flesh goes from the bones and the life from the
eyes, and the whole man becomes like some old, empty hulk, whose timbers
will hardly hold together! And all this from eating opium!”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” exclaimed Brisk; “leave opium to man; it is a great deal too
bad for rats!”</p>




<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<h3><a name = "chapII" id = "chapII">
CHAPTER II.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A CLAP-TRAP DISCOVERY.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">With</span> eager haste we scrambled into
the warehouse, Furry, as usual, remaining behind on account of his
infirmities. We were almost too impatient to wait till the men within
should have finished their work, till the doors should be shut and
locked, and the place left in quiet for us.</p>

<p>I soon found out what was to me a singular curiosity&mdash;a tooth; I
felt certain that it was a tooth; but it was twice as long as any rat,
counting from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail! I could not
help wondering in my mind to what huge animal it could ever have
belonged.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that called ivory?” said Oddity, as he waddled past me.</p>

<p>I felt inexpressible pleasure in gnawing and nibbling at the huge
tusk, and polishing my sharp teeth upon it. “How I should like to see
the enormous rat that could have carried such a tusk!” I exclaimed. “Oh!
how I
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
should delight in travelling and seeing the world!”</p>

<p>“You’ve something to see worth the seeing, without travelling far!”
cried Brisk. “Such a fragrance of cheese as there is yonder! Why, Ratto,
its delicious scent reaches us even here!”</p>

<p>I was so busy with my tusk and my reflections, that I scarcely looked
up; but Oddity turned his eyes eagerly towards the spot.</p>

<p>“Now, I propose that we have a race to the place!” cried Brisk; “and
he who gets first shall have his pick of the feast! Leave Ratto to his
old bone! Here are seven of us: now for it; once, twice, thrice, and
away!”</p>

<p>Off they scampered helter-skelter, all my seven brothers, awkward
heavy Oddity, as usual, in the rear. He had often been laughed at for
his slowness, but this time it was well for him that he was slow! On
rushed the six foremost, almost together, scrambling one over another in
their haste; they disappeared into what looked like a dark hole, and
then&mdash;alas! alas! what a terrible squeaking!</p>

<p>Poor unhappy brothers! all caught in a
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
trap! All at the mercy of their cruel enemy, man! I ran to the spot in a
terrible fright. Nothing of my six companions could I see; but Oddity,
with a very disconsolate look, was staring at the drop of the trap. His
had been a very narrow escape,&mdash;it had grazed his ugly nose as it
fell!</p>

<p>This is a very melancholy part of my story, and I will hasten over it
as fast as I can. In vain the poor captive rats tried to gnaw their way
to freedom from within, while Oddity and I nibbled from without. There
was something which defied even our sharp little teeth, and all our
efforts were in vain. My poor brothers could not touch the fatal feast
which had lured them to their ruin! They passed a miserable night, and
were every one carried off in a bag to be worried by dogs in the
morning!</p>

<p>“Cruel, wicked man!” I exclaimed, as with my piebald companion I
sought my old shelter behind the canvass in our shed. My exclamation was
overheard by old Furry.</p>

<p>“Cruel, wicked man!” he repeated, but in a different tone from mine;
“well, I think that even when setting a trap to catch inexperienced
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
rats, man may have something to say for himself. I have often noticed
the big creatures at work, and much they labour, and hard they toil, and
we can’t expect them to be willing to take so much trouble to collect
dainties just to feast us! Those who live on the property of others,
like rats, have no right to expect civil treatment!”</p>

<p>“Are there any creatures that lay traps for man?” said&nbsp;I, in the
bitterness of my spirit almost hoping that there might be.</p>

<p>“As well as I can understand,” replied Furry, “man himself lays traps
for man. I have seen several of these traps. They are large, and
generally built of brick, with a board and gilt letters in front. They
are baited with a certain drink, which has effects something like opium,
which destroys slowly but surely those who give themselves up recklessly
to its enjoyment.”</p>

<p>“Well,” cried Oddity, “having once seen what comes of running into a
trap,&nbsp;I, for one, shall be always on my guard against them, and am
never likely to be caught in that way. I suppose that it is the same
with man. When he sees that one or two of his companions are
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
lost by the big man-trap, he takes good care never to go near it
himself.”</p>

<p>“Not a whit!” exclaimed Furry, with a scornful whisk of his tail.
“They like the bait, though they know its effects quite well. They walk
with open eyes into the great man-trap, they hasten merrily into the
great man-trap, when the gas-lights are flaring, and the spirits
flowing, and the sound of laughter and jesting is heard within! They
know that they are going the straight, direct way to be worried by
sickness, poverty, and shame, (what these are I never heard clearly
explained, but I have gathered that they are great enemies of man, who
are always waiting at the door of the great man-trap,) and yet they go
gaily to their ruin!”</p>

<p>“So this is your account of the wise creature man!” I exclaimed; “he
is a great deal more foolish than any rat!”</p>

CHAPTER III.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">POORER THAN RATS.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> had not our shed always to
ourselves. One cold evening in autumn, when there was a sharp east wind,
and a drizzling rain, two human creatures came into the place and
cowered down in a corner of our shed. I call them human creatures, for
they certainly were not men; they were so different from the tall
powerful fellows whom I had occasionally seen at their work in the
warehouse. These were much smaller, and so thin that their bones seemed
almost ready to break through the skin. Their hair hung in long loose
masses about their ears. They had nothing on their feet to protect them
from the stones, and one of them had a hurt upon his heel, which looked
red and inflamed.</p>

<p>I found that these were young human beings, neglected and uncared
for, as young rats would not have been. We were at first afraid of them,
and only peered out curiously upon them from our holes and
hiding-places; but when, gathering courage, we ventured to
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
come forward, we seemed to frighten them as much as they had frightened
us.</p>

<p>“Look there&mdash;there, Bob!” screamed the younger child, clinging
more closely to his brother.</p>

<p>“Them bees rats,” said the other one more quietly. His poor thin
little face looked as if the life and spirit had been so starved out of
it, that he could not be much astonished at anything.</p>

<p>“I don’t like staying here, Bob, amongst the rats!” cried the
terrified little one, attempting to pull his brother towards the
entrance by the sleeve of his jacket. The wretched rag gave way even
under his weak pull, and another rent was added to the many by which the
cold crept in through the poor boy’s tattered dress. “I&nbsp;won’t stay
here; let us go, let us go!”</p>

<p>“We’ve no-wheres to go to,” replied Bob, in the same dull, lifeless
tone. “Never you mind the rats, Billy, them won’t hurt you,” he
added.</p>

<p>Hurt him! not we! If ever I felt pity it was for those ragged little
urchins. We were well-fed, but they were hungry; Nature had
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
given us sleek warm coats, but they trembled with cold. It was very
clear that it was much harder to them to support life than if they had
been rats. I wondered if in this great city there were many such
helpless children, and if there were none to care for them!</p>

<p>“I say, Ratto,” observed Oddity, licking his soft coat till the
beautiful polish upon it made one almost forget its ugly colour, “’tis a
pity that these children are so dirty; but may be they are not so
particular about such matters as we rats.”</p>

<p>In time a sort of acquaintance grew up between me and the ragged
boys. We ceased to fear each other, and I would venture almost close to
Billy’s thin little hand when he had a crust of bread to eat, for he
always broke off a little bit for me. The poor little fellow was
crippled and lame, so he rarely left the shed. Bob often went out in the
morning, and returned when it was growing dark, sometimes with food, and
sometimes without it; but whenever he had anything to eat, he always
shared it with his little lame brother. I see them now, crouched close
up together for the sake of warmth. Sometimes Billy cried from
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
hunger and cold, and his tears made long lines down his grimy face. Bob
never cried, he suffered quite quietly; he patted his little brother’s
shaggy head, and spoke kindly to him, in his dull, cheerless way. I felt
more sorry for him than for Billy.</p>

<p>The little one was the more talkative of the two. Perhaps he was more
lively in his nature; or perhaps, from having been a shorter time in a
world of sorrow, he had not learned its sad lessons so well. I certainly
never heard him laugh but once, and then it was when Oddity, who was
more shy than&nbsp;I, ventured for the first time since Billy’s coming
to cross the shed.</p>

<p>“Oh! look&mdash;look, Bob! what a funny rat! what a beauty rat!” he
cried, clapping his bony hands together with childish glee.</p>

<p>It was comical to see the expression on Oddity’s blunt face on
hearing this unexpected compliment, perhaps the first that he had ever
received in his life. It was enough to have turned the head of a less
sober rat; but he, honest fellow, only lifted up his snub nose with a
sort of bull-dog look, which seemed to say, “Well, there’s no accounting
for taste.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<p>“Bob,” said little Billy one evening, with more animation than usual,
“I’se been a-watching the rats, and I saw&mdash;only think what I
saw!”</p>

<p>“Eh, what did ye see?” replied Bob, drowsily, rubbing his eyes with
the back of his hand. He looked very hungry and tired.</p>

<p>“I was a-watching for the fat spotted one which ran across yesterday,
when out came creeping, creeping, two others”&mdash;the child with his
fingers on the floor suited his action to his words,&mdash;“and one had
some white on its back; it looked old and weak; and Bob, I saw as how it
was blind.”</p>

<p>“A blind rat!” cried Bob; “’twould soon starve, I take it.”</p>

<p>“But there was the other rat at its side, with such shining eyes, and
such a sharp little nose!” I plead guilty to vanity; I could not hear
such a description of myself with Oddity’s sober composure. “And the old
blind rat had a little bit of stick in its mouth, just as the blind man
in the lane has a stick in his hand, and the pretty black rat took the
other end in his teeth, and so pulled the old un on his way.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<p>“I’se never heard of rats doing that afore,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s not all that I saw about ’em,” continued Billy. “Out comes
the funny spotted rat from its hole; so I keeps very quiet, not to
frighten it away. And it pattered up to the place where I put the little
crumbs; and what do you think as it did?”</p>

<p>“Ate them,” was Bob’s quiet reply.</p>

<p>“No, but it didn’t though!” cried Billy, triumphantly; “it pushed
them towards the old blind rat. Neither the black un nor the spotted un
ate up one crumb; they left ’em all for the poor blind rat! Now wasn’t
them famous little fellows!”</p>

<p>“So rats help one another,” said Bob. He did not speak more; but as
he leant back his head, and looked straight up at the roof of the shed,
(there was a great hole in it which the stars shone through, and now and
then a big drop of water from the top came plash, plash, on the muddy
floor below,) he looked up, I say, and I wonder whether he was thinking
the same thing as I was at that moment: “Rats help one another; do none
but human beings leave their fellow-creatures to perish!”</p>

CHAPTER IV.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">HOW I MADE A FRIEND.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">I always</span> ate my supper in the
warehouse, but I need hardly say that Oddity and I carefully avoided the
spot where the tragedy of our six brothers had occurred. We were by no
means the only rats who found a living in the place at the expense of
our enemy, man. There were a good many of the species of the large brown
Norwegian rat; but as I have mentioned before, we usually kept out of
their way, from a tender regard for our own ears.</p>

<p>There was one brown rat, however, whose fame had spread, not only in
his own tribe, but in ours. For quickness of wit, readiness in danger,
strength of teeth, and courage in using them, I have never yet met with
his equal. Whiskerandos was a hero of a rat. Was it not he who in single
combat had met and conquered a young ferret! an exploit in itself quite
sufficient to establish his fame as a warrior. They had been opposed to
each other in a room lighted by a single window. Whiskerandos, whose
intelligence at once
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
showed him the importance of position, took his station beneath this
window, so that the light was in his enemy’s eyes, and compelled him to
fight at disadvantage. For two long hours the battle lasted, but at
length the ferret lay dead upon the floor!</p>

<p>Several scars upon the neck of Whiskerandos bore witness to this
terrible encounter, and many others in which he had been engaged. He had
lost one ear, and the other had been grievously curtailed of its
proportions, so that altogether he had paid for fame at the price of
beauty; but he was strong and bold as ever, and his appearance one night
in our warehouse created quite a sensation in the community of rats.</p>

<p>There was one brown rat, in particular, that seemed to wait upon him,
and pay him court, as though, having no merit of his own, Shabby fancied
that he could borrow a little from a distinguished companion. I have
often seen this in life, (I&nbsp;am now an old and experienced rat,) I
have seen a mean race following and flattering their superiors, ready to
lick the dust from their feet, not from real admiration or attachment,
but, like a mistletoe upon a
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
forest tree, because they had no proper footing of their own, and liked
to be raised on the credit of another. It is easier to them to fawn than
to work, to flatter the great than to follow their example.</p>

<p>I own that I was afraid of Whiskerandos, and yet he passed without
touching me, quite above the meanness of hurting a creature merely
because it was weaker than himself. But Shabby gave such a savage snap
at my ear that I retreated squeaking into a corner. I almost think that
I should have returned the bite, had not his formidable companion been
so near; and it was probably this circumstance which gave the mean rat
courage thus to attack me without provocation. From what I have heard of
boys tormenting cats, mice, birds, anything that they can easily master,
while they pay proper respect to bulldogs and mastiffs, I have an idea
that there are some Shabbys to be found even amongst “the lords of
creation.”</p>

<p>I was busy at my supper, when, chancing to look towards the fatal
hole in which my six brothers had been caught, I saw Whiskerandos and
his follower merrily advancing towards
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
it, doubtless attracted, as the former victims had been, by a very
enticing scent.</p>

<p>I do not know how man would have behaved in my position. These
certainly were no friends of mine; but then they were rats; they were of
the race of Mus. I could not see them perish without warning them of
their danger.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” squeaked I, keeping, however, at a respectful distance;
“you are running right into a trap!”</p>

<p>Whiskerandos turned sharp round and faced me. I retreated back
several steps.</p>

<p>“Bite him,&mdash;fight him,&mdash;shake him by the neck!” cried
Shabby; “he knows there is a dainty feast there, and he would keep it
all for his ugly black rats!” Shabby was a great fighter with words;
those of his character usually are; nor was he in the least particular,
when he gave his bad names, that they were in the least suitable and
appropriate, or he would never have applied the term “ugly” to us.</p>

<p>“You’ll pay for your dainty feast if you go one foot farther!” I
exclaimed; feeling, I confess it, very angry.</p>

<p>“Who’s afraid!” cried the boaster, flinging
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
up his hind legs with a saucy flourish as he scampered on. Clap! he was
caught in the trap!</p>

<p>Poor rat! had he possessed the courage and skill of Whiskerandos
himself, they would have availed him nothing. His miserable squeaking
was louder than that of all my six brothers put together. He would not
take advice, and he found the consequences. He thought himself wiser
than his neighbours, and only discovered his mistake when it had led him
to destruction. Had he only listened to the counsels of a little black
rat!</p>

<p>Whiskerandos remained for some moments quite still, looking towards
the dismal prison of his companion. He knew too well that it was
impossible to rescue him now. Then, with such bounds as few rats but
himself could make, he sprang to where I was standing.</p>

<p>“Rat!” he exclaimed, “you have saved my life, and I shall never
forget the obligation. Though you are black and I am brown, no
difference between us shall ever be regarded. Let us be friends to the
end of our days!”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” I cried; “let’s rub noses upon it!” and noses we
accordingly rubbed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<p>He never flinched from his word, that bold Whiskerandos. I never
feared him from that hour; no, not even when I knew that he was hungry,
and had tasted no food from morning till night; I knew that no extremity
would ever induce him to eat up his friend; and many a ramble have we
had together, and through many strange paths has he led me. I ventured
even into the haunts of the brown rats, for his presence was a
sufficient protection. None would have dared to attack me while he was
beside me,&mdash;I should hardly have been afraid of a cat!</p>

<p>I had naturally a fancy for roving, and a great desire to know more
of the world; and what better guide could I have had than the heroic
Whiskerandos? He had not, however, been so great a traveller as
Furry,&mdash;he had never yet crossed the water; but he and I
determined, on some favourable opportunity, to take our passage in a
ship, and explore some foreign region together.</p>

<p>There was but one subject on which Whiskerandos and I were ever in
danger of quarrelling. I had made up my mind&mdash;and Furry, who was a
very learned rat, was quite of the same
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
opinion&mdash;that the ancestors of the brown rats came over from
Hanover to England with George&nbsp;I. We liked to call them Hanover
rats, but this gave great offence to the race, as it made their
antiquity so much less than that which we claimed for ourselves.</p>

<p>“You affirm,” Whiskerandos would exclaim, “that you came over from
Normandy in 1066, and we from Hanover in 1714, and that nothing was ever
heard of us before that time. I affirm that it is a calumny, a base
calumny! We came from Persia, from the land of the East; an army of us
swam across the Volga, driven by an earthquake from our own country.
Depend upon it, we were known there in ancient times, and went over
Xerxes’ great bridge of boats, and nibbled at his tent-ropes and gnawed
his cheese while he fought with the Greeks at Thermopylæ.”</p>

<p>“After all,” thought I&mdash;I did not say it aloud, for the great
weakness of Whiskerandos was his pride of birth, his anxiety to be
thought of an ancient family&mdash;“the great matter is not whether our
ancestors do honour to us, but whether by our conduct we do not disgrace
our ancestors.”</p>

CHAPTER V.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">HOW BOB MET WITH AN ADVENTURE.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">I was</span> often puzzled by the conduct
of Bob; that was to be expected, seeing that I was a young and ignorant
rat, quite inexperienced in the doings of man. Once or twice Bob had
brought to the shed things which he could not eat and did not wear. I
could neither imagine where he had got them, what he intended to do with
them, nor what possible use he could make of them. He seemed inclined to
hide them; and once, when he was showing to Billy a red handkerchief
covered with white spots (though the weather was bitterly cold, he never
attempted to tie it round his neck), the little boy looked up gravely
into his face and said, “Oh, Bob, arn’t you afeard?”</p>

<p>“What am I to do; we can’t starve, Billy.” He looked so wan and so
woe-begone, as he bent over the little lame child, that it seemed to me
that never was a creature so wretched as that desolate boy. The next
morning he took away the handkerchief, and in the evening he brought
home bread.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<p>Once when he returned, the snow was fast falling, drifting through
the roof, and in at the door, till Billy could scarcely find a clear
spot on which to rest his languid little frame. He was always on the
look-out for his brother, as soon as the sky began to darken. Well might
he watch on that day, for he had not broken his fast since the evening
before; and his lips were blue with hunger and cold, and he was lonely,
very lonely, in the shed.</p>

<p>Presently Bob came hastily in; we had not heard his step on the soft
snow. The flakes were resting on his rags and whitening his hair, as he
threw himself down by his brother.</p>

<p>“Oh! Billy!” he exclaimed, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“What have you got?” cried the little one joyfully. “A&nbsp;big
loaf!” and he tore it asunder in his eager haste, and ate like a
famished creature.</p>

<p>“And see this!” said Bob; and he wrapped round the shivering child a
warm cloak which he had carried on his arm.</p>

<p>Billy opened his eyes with an expression of astonishment, which
brightened into joy as he felt the unwonted warmth. “Oh! Bob!”
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
he exclaimed, with his mouth full of bread; “where did you get this? Did
you steal it?”</p>

<p>“No; and I’ll never steal no more; never, never!” and the boy sank
his head down upon his chest, and sobbed. I had never seen him shed a
tear till that day.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, tell me!” cried Billy, almost frightened by
his brother’s unwonted emotion; but it was a little time before Bob made
reply.</p>

<p>“I followed he&mdash;a fine, tall gemman. I had my fingers in his
pocket, and he clapped his hand on ’em, and catched me!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Billy, with eyes and mouth wide open, in alarm. “And
did he not call the beaks, and have you up?”</p>

<p>“No; he spoke to me; he spoke so kind-like. He told me that I was
<ins class = "correction" title = "text shown as printed: missing words?">about a</ins> sin&mdash;a great sin. Nobody never spoke so to me
afore!” Again the boy’s feelings seemed ready to burst forth. “And he
took me to a baker’s, and got me this; and to a shop, and bought me
that; and says he, “Has no one taught you to know right from wrong?” And
says&nbsp;I, “Nobody never taught me nothing!”
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
Then he takes me a good way round, down a little lane, right into a
Ragged School.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Billy curiously.</p>

<p>“A place where a great many poor boys were together in a big room,
where there were wooden benches, and pictures and other things hung on
the walls. I should never have dared to go in; but that good gemman took
me, and led me right up to a man who was standing with a row of little
chaps afore him. And the gemman put his hand on my shoulder, and spoke
for me, and said a many things that I can’t remember; but one thing I
remember quite well: “You come here every evening,” says he, “and you’ll
be taught your duty, and how to do it. I am leaving London soon; but I
will be back in a few weeks, and I’ll come and ask the master how you
have been behaving; and if I find that you’ve been trying to become a
better boy, I will not lose sight of you, my friend<ins class =
"correction" title = "no second ”">.”</ins></p>

<p>“Did the gemman say all that?” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>“And a great deal more. Such beautiful talking! And to see how gentle
and kind he
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
looked, as if he didn’t think me such a bad un after all!”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him of me?” asked Billy anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes; I told him that I had one little brother, and he was lame; and
that mother was dead and father in jail, and that we had no one to care
for us, and that we were often hungry, and always cold; and he looked
quite sorry to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Did he though?” cried Billy, much surprised. “And will you go to the
Ragged School, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“Won’t I!” cried the boy, with a little more energy than I had seen
in him before; “why, if I don’t, I won’t see that good gemman
again!”</p>

<p>“And won’t you take me with you too?” said little Billy.</p>

CHAPTER VI.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">HOW I VISITED THE ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">That</span> night I set out with
Whiskerandos on more extended travels than any which I had yet
attempted. Oddity might have accompanied us, but he preferred, as he
said, home comforts and a nibble in the warehouse. I knew that he would
look after old Furry, whose infirmities were sadly increasing upon him,
so that I had no fear of the blind rat being neglected.</p>

<p>I suspected that more than one reason induced my pie-bald brother to
decline the tour. He had struck up an acquaintance with Bright-eyes, a
lively little rat, and probably found his society more agreeable than
that of Whiskerandos, of whom he always stood somewhat in awe. I shall
not pause on the description of our underland journey through the
wondrous labyrinth of passages which, like a net-work, spreads in every
direction under the foundations of London. I saw more rats in these
gloomy lanes than I had ever imagined existed in the world. I should
have been
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
afraid to have passed them, so fierce they looked, so ready to attack an
intruder, had not Whiskerandos been at my side. He neither provoked
contests, nor feared them&mdash;neither gave offence willingly, nor took
it readily&mdash;but had withal so resolute an air, that few would have
been disposed to have quarrelled with him. I was heartily glad, however,
when again we emerged into the light of day; and I was full of
astonishment at the sight of green grass and trees, such as I had never
beheld before.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Whiskerandos, smiling at my delight, “you should see this
grass in the fresh spring, and those black bare trees when the bright
young leaves are upon them. The branches of yonder row seem dropping
their blossoms of gold; and how sweet is the scent of the hawthorn! But
I would not have you pass through that iron paling to examine more
closely the beauties of the garden; the square would be a charming
place, no doubt, if it were not haunted by cats.”</p>

<p>I had never seen a cat in my life, but I started instinctively at the
name. “Take me anywhere,” I exclaimed, “take me anywhere
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
that you will, so that I never come in sight of one of those terrible
creatures!”</p>

<p>“I am going,” said Whiskerandos, “to take you where there are cats so
huge that one could take a man’s head in her mouth, or strike him dead
by a blow of her paw!”</p>

<p>“Oh, for my shed! Oh, for my quiet hole! for Furry, and Oddity, and
my peaceable companions!” thought&nbsp;I. “What folly it was to venture
into the world with such a guide as this desperado, Whiskerandos!”</p>

<p>I suppose that the bold rat read my thoughts in my frightened face,
for he hastened to reassure my mind. “The big cats,” said he, “some with
long flowing manes, some spotted, some striped black and yellow, have no
power to harm us. They are kept in barred cages by man, and spend their
lives in wearisome captivity, denied even the solace of amusing
themselves by catching a mouse for supper.”</p>

<p>It was the dawn of a winter’s morning, when with my comrade I merrily
made my way across the park. The grass was whitened with hoar-frost,
which also glittered on the leafless boughs of the rows of trees which
lined the long straight avenue. We entered the
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
gardens without paying toll, or in any way obtruding ourselves on the
notice of man.</p>

<p>“See here!” exclaimed Whiskerandos, half pettishly, as we passed a
pond with a curious wire-fence all round it. “What a dainty breakfast we
should make of some of the delicate young water-fowl, but for the
extraordinary care which has been taken to shut us out! We can look in,
to be sure, and see our prey, but the ducks do not even flutter, or move
a wing, so secure are they that we cannot reach them!”</p>

<p>The season being winter, we were unable to see many animals from
tropical climes, whose health would have suffered from exposure to cold.
I however regretted this but little. The white bear was shaking his
shaggy coat, the wolf pacing uneasily up and down his den, birds pluming
their feathers in the dull red light, while the monkeys’ ceaseless
jabber sounded from the walls of their prison.</p>

<p>“Whiskerandos,” said I to my guide, “I care little for making
acquaintance with cats, whether they be little or big; but if any
foreigners of the race of Mus be kept here, might I request you to
introduce me to them?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<p>Whiskerandos pointed with his nose towards a building. “You will find
relations there,” he said, “some of the forty-six classes of our race,
known by the family likeness in their teeth.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> For me, I’m going to pay a
visit to the monkeys’ house; I’m sure there to find some provision,
always a matter of importance to a rat. The door is shut, but I’ll not
trouble the keeper to open it for me!” So saying, with wonderful agility
he began to climb the building, and soon vanished through a hole in the
roof.</p>

<p>Food was to me a subject of at least as great importance as to
Whiskerandos. Even my curiosity had to wait attendance on my appetite. I
was fortunate, however, in discovering half a bun, which had probably
been dropped by some child; and cheered and refreshed I proceeded to the
building in which I was to make my affectionate search for distant
relations. I carefully examined the walls, till I discovered a hole,
probably made by some rat of the place, and through this I entered the
house, and proceeded at once
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
with eagerness to a small barred division, from whence a feeble squeak
proceeded.</p>

<p>“<span class = "firstword">Well</span>, this is at length such
weather as a creature may live and breathe in! I’ve been half stifled
all the autumn with the heat, but now the fresh keen air seems like a
breeze from my own dear Lapland!”</p>

<p>“Lapland! oh! there is nothing like Lapland,” said a very dolorous
voice in reply. I lifted up my eyes to get a glimpse of the speaker.</p>

<p>Within the cage were two beautiful little Lemmings, (I&nbsp;learnt
their name afterwards as well as those of other inhabitants of the
place.) They were not much more than half my size, had pointed heads,
very short tails, and whiskers uncommonly long. Their coats were black
and tawny, but yellowish-white beneath. I heard subsequently that their
race inhabit Siberia, Norway, and other cold climes, moving in large
bodies like locusts, and like locusts
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
eating up every thing green. But this pair, as was evident from their
conversation, had been natives of a country called Lapland.</p>

<p>“Oh for a sight of the icy lakes, the snow-covered plains and the
reindeer moving lightly over them; while the rosy Aurora Borealis throws
its bright streamers across the sky!”</p>

<p>“And the strange little huts,” rejoined the other, “made of briers,
bark, felt, and reindeer skins, where, when we peeped under the curtains
which made the door, we saw the tiny people, in their sheepskin
doublets, sitting on their heels round the fire! I don’t wonder that the
Lapps love their land; I don’t wonder that when long exiled from it,
they die of intense longing to return. That will be my fate, oh! that
will be mine!”</p>

<p>“Allow an English rat, gentle strangers,” said I, “to offer a little
word of comfort. I grieve that you feel your captivity so much, that you
so deeply mourn your absence from your dear native land. But is it not
better to meet misfortune with courage, and bear it with patience? You
are yet left the society of each other, you can yet talk over old days
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
together, while the white bear growls in his prison alone, and the lofty
camel has no companion near him.”</p>

<p>I was interrupted by some animal near dashing itself passionately
against the bars of its cage, and, turning round, I beheld a very savage
rat, which bore the name of the German Hamster. His head was thick,
blunt, and garnished with plenty of whiskers; he had big eyes, and
large, open, rounded ears. His back and head were of a reddish-brown
colour, his cheeks red, his feet white, and he had three odd white spots
on each side of his chest. But the funniest thing which I noticed about
him, (I&nbsp;was always an observant rat,) was that he had a claw on his
forefeet in addition to four toes, which I had never before seen in the
tribes of Mus.</p>

<p>“’Tis easy to talk of comfort!” he exclaimed angrily, “when a rat has
freedom and everything else that he cares for! But here&mdash;why I have
not even the comfort of going to sleep after the fashion of my
country!”</p>

<p>“Not going to sleep!” I repeated in some surprise, thinking to myself
that so peevish a creature must certainly be best in his sleep.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<p>“No; who can sleep on bare boards, or a poor sprinkling of straw!” he
exclaimed, striking contemptuously the floor of his cage. “I&nbsp;who
used to burrow deep in the earth, and enjoy a long nap all during the
winter, shut up in my snug little home, I know what comfort is! There is
nothing like lying some feet under the earth, as quiet as if one were
dead, and know that there is a good magazine collected of grain, beans,
and pease, to feast on when one awakes in the spring.”</p>

<p>“But at any rate here you are well fed,” I suggested.</p>

<p>The words, however kindly intended, had only the effect of increasing
the Hamster’s passion to a shocking extent. To my amazement and horror
he blew out his cheeks till the size of his head and neck exceeded that
of his body. He raised himself on his hind legs, and but for the bars of
his cage I believe that he would really have flown at me.</p>

<p>“Well fed!” he exclaimed, as soon as he could speak; “I&nbsp;should
like to know what you call being well fed! Since I have come to this
hateful country, not once have I had an opportunity of filling my cheeks
with grain.
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
Man, stingy man, thinks it enough to give me a wretched pittance from
day to day,&mdash;to me who have had a hundred pounds of corn packed up
in my own deep hole,&mdash;to me whose delight it was to carry three
ounces weight of it at once in these bags with which Nature has provided
my face!”</p>

<p>“Most curious and convenient bags they are,” said&nbsp;I, willing to
appease him by a civil word, though I thought that thus puffed out with
air, they anything but added to the beauty of his appearance.</p>

<p>“They were the cause of my being taken,” cried the fierce Hamster,
whose savage complaints had quite silenced the gentler murmurs of the
pretty little Lemmings, and had done more perhaps to make them
submissive to their lot than anything which I could have said.</p>

<p>“How were your pouches the cause of your being taken?”
inquired&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>“I can fight savagely&mdash;I will fly even at dogs,” replied the
Hamster (no&nbsp;one could have looked at him and have doubted it,) “but
I cannot bite when my cheeks are stuffed full of grain, which was the
case when a German
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
peasant seized me; I had no time to empty them, not a moment, or
wouldn’t I have bitten him! oh, would not I have bitten him!”</p>

<p>I felt so much disgusted at the words and manner of this most
ferocious of rats, that I was glad to turn away from his cage;
reflecting to myself how hideous and how hateful any creature is
rendered by violent passion.</p>

<p>A perfume, rather more powerful than agreeable, drew my attention
towards a division occupied by a Musk-Rat, a native of Canada. I saw
within it a creature of the size of a small rabbit, quiet and staid in
his demeanour, who welcomed me with a grave courtesy strangely in
contrast to the rudeness of the Hamster.</p>

<p>“May I venture to look upon you as belonging to the race of Mus?” I
inquired, looking doubtingly at his large size, soft fur, and long flat
tail.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, good-humouredly, “some naturalists, and I believe
the great Linnæus amongst them, class me with the Castor or Beaver race,
and dignify me with a very long and learned-sounding name, Zibethicus.
But I am quite content, for my part, to own my
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
relationship to the race of Mus, and to be known by the simple name
Musk-Rat, which they give me on the lakes of Canada.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted,” said I, with a wave of my whiskers, “at this
opportunity of paying my respects to so dignified a relation.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied Zibethicus, “I only wish that I could have received you
in my own house upon the Lake Huron. If you could but have seen the
pretty round dwelling raised by myself and my companions&mdash;the neat
dome-shaped roof which covered it, formed of herbs and reeds cemented
with clay. So prettily it was stuccoed within! A great deal of trouble
it cost us, to be sure, but I often think there’s no pleasure without
trouble; and there’s nothing in my captivity which I miss so much as the
power to labour and build.”</p>

<p>“May I ask,” said I, “whether you be of the same family with the Musk
Cavy, which I have heard of as inhabiting Ceylon and other places in the
East?”</p>

<p>“I believe not,” answered my courteous companion, “but we doubtless
belong to the same race, however our habits and appearance may
differ.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<p>Our pleasant conversation was here unfortunately interrupted by the
keeper’s opening the door. I had barely time to hide myself under some
straw, resolving not to show myself again till darkness should render it
safe for me to creep out.</p>

<p>Soon various visitors arrived, and I was vastly amused by watching
the different varieties of the human species, of which there must be
nearly as many as of the race of Mus. For the first time in my life I
saw ladies all bedizened in velvets and silks, and the furry spoils of
many an unfortunate ermine or sable. I saw gentlemen too, and I confess
that a creeping uncomfortable feeling came over me when I looked at the
hats which they had on their heads, the fine black gloss was so
exceedingly like that of the coat which I wore. I have since learnt that
my conjecture was but too close to the fact&mdash;that numberless
hapless rats are slaughtered in France on account of their fatal beauty;
and that man not only manufactures their fur into hats, but uses their
soft and delicate skins to make the thumbs of his best gloves. Alas, for
the race of Mus!</p>

CHAPTER VIII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">HOW I HEARD OF OLD NEIGHBOURS.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the afternoon a gentleman entered
the building, whose noble and commanding appearance struck me. After a
short examination of the captives in their cages, he sat down to rest
himself nearly opposite the place where I was hidden.</p>

<p>He was almost directly joined by a bright-haired boy, in whose cheeks
health was glowing, and whose blue eyes sparkled with intelligence and
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Papa&mdash;please&mdash;I want more money to buy buns for the
animals!”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” replied the gentleman, in an expostulating tone, “you
have had a whole dozen already; I do not think it right to spend more on
pampering well-fed animals, when so many of our fellow-creatures are
suffering from hunger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! do you think there are many?”</p>

<p>“I believe that in this city of London alone there are
thousands,&mdash;yes, tens of thousands, who know not, when they rise in
the morning,
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
where they shall find a morsel of food during the day. I did not tell
you what happened to me when I was in the city, Neddy.”</p>

<p>“Do tell me now,” cried the boy, seating himself by his father,
“while we rest a little quietly here.”</p>

<p>“I was walking along a narrow gloomy lane on my way to the
shipping-office, when suddenly I felt a hand at my pocket. Mine was
instantly down upon it, and I captured a little thief who appeared to be
about your own age.”</p>

<p>“The little rogue!” exclaimed Neddy, indignantly. “And what did you
do with him, papa? Did you give him over to the police, or thrash him
soundly with your stick?”</p>

<p>“I grieved to see one so young already plunging into crime.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the worst of it,” said Neddy. “If he is so bad as a
boy, what will he be when he is a man! He will be sure to end on the
gallows! I hope you punished him well, papa.”</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears on hearing this conversation; I could not help
connecting it with what Bob had told his lame little brother;
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
I therefore listened with peculiar interest. Not that, as a rat, I could
understand the word <i>crime</i>, or know why human beings feel it wrong
to seize anything that they want and can get. It was evident to me that
they are governed by laws and principles quite incomprehensible to my
race. For as man has no scruple in taking from rats their lives and
their skins, so rats, on the other hand, have no manner of scruple in
taking all they require from man.</p>

<p>But to return to the gentleman and his son.</p>

<p>“No, Neddy, I did not punish the child,” replied the former gravely.
<ins class = "correction" title = "“ missing">“I</ins>&nbsp;looked at
his meagre form clothed in rags, his wasted countenance prematurely old
in its expression of sorrow and care, his hollow eyes, his sunken
cheeks,&mdash;and I thought of you, my son!” the gentleman added, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Neddy, “I hope there’s a precious deal of difference
between me and a beggarly thief!”</p>

<p>“What has made that difference?” said the gentleman, laying his hand
on the shoulder of his beautiful boy. “I&nbsp;questioned that unhappy
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
child. I found him ignorant of the first principles of virtue. His
mother is dead, his father in jail; if he has learnt anything from those
around him it is only a knowledge of vice. Pinched by hunger, homeless,
friendless, ignorant even that he has a soul, it would be a miracle
indeed if he followed the straight path of which he has not so much as
heard! What can we expect him to be but a thief,&mdash;what would you
have been in his place?”</p>

<p>Neddy looked thoughtful and was silent. Then raising his blue eyes to
his father’s face he said, “And what did you do to the boy?”</p>

<p>“I first tried to relieve a little his pressing bodily wants; to take
from him, at least for one day, the temptation to commit a theft. But I
knew that the temptation would recur again, and as long as he continued
in blind ignorance, there could be small hope that he would even wish to
resist it. I remembered that my watchmaker had given me the direction of
a Ragged School at which his daughter taught; spending her time and
energies as so many do now, in this noblest labour of love. This school
was not very far off, and I resolved
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
to take this opportunity of paying it a long-intended visit. I took the
poor little fellow with me, and spoke to the superintendent, who readily
agreed to receive him. He will there learn some way to earn his bread
honestly; he will be taught to know right from wrong; he will hear,
perhaps for the first time, the voice of kindness; and he may yet live
to be respectable, useful, and happy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! papa, do you think that after once being a thief he is ever
likely to turn out good for anything!”</p>

<p>“The experiment has been tried over and over again, Neddy, and many
times it has been mercifully attended with success. The idle <i>have</i>
become industrious, the thieves honest, the vicious been reclaimed, the
lost found and saved! I will tell you a striking occurrence which really
took place in a reformatory for thieves. Not one of the inmates there
but had broken the laws of his country, and committed the crime of
theft. But mercy was giving them a chance to redeem the characters which
they had lost, and they were learning various trades, by which to
support themselves in honest independence. A subscription, as
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
you may remember, was raised at the time of the war with Russia, to help
the widows and orphans of our gallant soldiers. From the Sovereign on
her throne, to the labourer in the field, from rich and poor, high and
low, contributions to the Patriotic Fund poured in.</p>

<p>“The thieves in the reformatory heard of the subscription; they
longed to aid it, but what could they do? they had no money, they owed
their very bread to charity, for they had not yet acquired sufficient
skill in the trades which they were learning, to pay even their
necessary expenses.”</p>

<p>“They could not give what they had not got, papa, if they wished to
be generous ever so much.”</p>

<p>“Where there is a will there is a way, Neddy. These poor fellows were
so anxious to help the widow and the orphan, that they asked and
obtained leave to go a whole day without food, that the money so saved
upon them might be paid into the Patriotic Fund.”</p>

<p>“And did they really starve a whole day?&mdash;have neither
breakfast, nor dinner, nor supper,&mdash;and all go hungry to bed?”</p>

<p>“They did, Neddy, <i>all</i> the thieves in that
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
reformatory<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> did; and I doubt if amongst the hundreds of thousands of
subscriptions to the Patriotic Fund, any showed so much real generosity
and self-denial as the contribution of the reformed thieves!”</p>

<p>“Oh! there was hope for such men indeed!” exclaimed Neddy, the
moisture rising into his eyes. “There must have been good in them, papa,
and I should not wonder if some of them turned out really fine
fellows.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” said his father with a smile.</p>

<p>“And that poor boy&mdash;yes, I hope that he may amend. Shall we hear
anything more of him, papa?”</p>

<p>“You know that we go out of town to-morrow. On my return I shall make
inquiries regarding him at the Ragged School, and if I find that he is
improving under the instruction which he will receive, I shall try to do
something for him.”</p>

<p>“May I go with you?” said Neddy eagerly, “I should like to visit the
school.”</p>

<p>“I think that I shall take you with me,” replied his father.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<p>“What a glorious thing it is,” exclaimed the boy after a pause, “to
raise ragged schools and reformatories, to give the poor, the ignorant,
and the wicked, a chance of becoming honest and happy! How I should like
to build one myself<ins class = "correction" title = "” missing">!”</ins></p>

<p>“It would be more practicable for you,” observed the gentleman,
smiling as he rose from his seat, “to support those which are built
already.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a></p>

<p>“But, papa, I can do so little!”</p>

<p>“Every little helps, my son; the vast ocean is made up of drops. You
may do something yourself, and try to interest others in the cause of
the desolate poor. Were all the children
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
of the middle classes in England to give each but one penny a-week, no
wretched boy need wander about desolate in London, to perish both here
and hereafter because no one cared for his soul!”</p>

The office of the “Ragged School Union” is at 1 Exeter Hall, London. By
this admirable society twenty-two thousand poor children have received
instruction during the past year, while five hundred of the most
destitute have been provided with homes in refuges and reformatories. To
show the habits of prudence inculcated in the schools, it is only
necessary to state that in the same year ragged scholars placed in
saving-banks a sum of no less than three thousand four hundred and
thirty-nine pounds! Seventy of those who now teach in the schools, were
once ragged scholars themselves, thus imparting to others the benefits
which they had received when poor ignorant children.</p>

<p>But the funds of the society are by no means sufficient for the work
before it, though many of its teachers are unpaid, seeking no reward
upon earth. There are numbers of ragged children in London, as desolate
as those whom I have described, who have never known the blessing of a
ragged school, and who, if they implored the shelter of a refuge, must
implore in vain, for they would find no room.</p>

CHAPTER IX.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">HOW WE FOUND A FEAST.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">I remained</span> in the Zoological Gardens
for a few weeks, improving my acquaintance with the mild Zibethicus and
the gentle Lemmings. As for the German Hamster, he became so drowsy as
the weather grew colder, that it became evident that he could sleep day
and night upon boards, though he never fell into the perfectly torpid,
almost dead state that he would have done, could he have been humoured
by being buried alive.</p>

<p>I should willingly have remained longer in the gardens, but the
keepers were taking such stringent measures to get rid of rats, that we
thought it better to remove on our own four feet while we could, instead
of being carried in a bag, a kind of conveyance for which we
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
had no fancy. We therefore<a class = "tag" name = "endtagA" id =
"endtagA" href = "#endnoteA">A</a> set out on our journey homewards.</p>

<p>We again chose the underland route, lest we should meet with dogs and
cats in the streets, or be crushed beneath rolling wheels. We had not
gone far, however, when Whiskerandos suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>“I feel hungry,” said he.</p>

<p>“So do I,” rejoined I.</p>

<p>“We must find our way into one of the houses,” observed the bold rat;
“let’s turn down this passage, it doubtless leads to some kitchen.”</p>

<p>Down the passage we accordingly turned, Whiskerandos, as usual, going
first; but we were met, almost at the entrance, by two savage brown
rats, who did not seem disposed to allow us to pass.</p>

<p>“Pray, does this passage lead to a kitchen?” said Whiskerandos, not
appearing to notice their sharp teeth and gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied one; “but the passage, and the house, and the kitchen,
belong to us, and we let no one share in our rights.”</p>

<p>“Any one who attempts to pass,” cried the other, very fiercely, “has
to pay us toll with his ears!”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<p>“Well, my good friends,” replied Whiskerandos, “notwithstanding the
darkness I have no doubt but that your bright eyes have observed that I
have paid that toll already, and that is a kind of toll which no one is
expected to pay twice.” The brown rats looked at the warrior with keen,
wondering gaze, while Whiskerandos calmly continued, “I&nbsp;lost my
ears in single combat with a ferret; he who exacted the toll lost his
life in exchange, and I feel somehow persuaded that you will rather
politely guide me into your house and share with me whatever I get
there, than try the experiment whether a rat can fight as well without
ears as he once did with them.”</p>

<p>This little speech had a most wonderful effect in subduing all
unfriendly and inhospitable feelings on the part of the brown rats
towards the valiant Whiskerandos. They, however, looked very
suspiciously at me, and I fancied that I heard one whisper to the other,
“There’s a black rat&mdash;an intruder&mdash;an enemy&mdash;we must tear
him in pieces!”</p>

<p>I felt uncommonly uncomfortable, and much inclined to turn round and
scamper for my life; but Whiskerandos soon ended the difficulty.
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
“Let me introduce to you my friend Ratto,” said he, “my very particular
friend, who goes where I go, shares what I find, and whose safety I
value as my own.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about tearing me in pieces, so we all proceeded
amicably on our way, till the brown rats led us through a small hole,
and we found ourselves in a large, airy kitchen.</p>

<p>The place was perfectly quiet; the loud ticking of the clock was the
only sound heard, the swing of its pendulum the only motion seen, except
that a few black beetles were creeping on the sanded floor. The fire,
which must have been a very large one, had almost burnt out; but a few
red embers still were glowing, and served to light us on our way,
though, as I have mentioned before, light seems unnecessary to rats.</p>

<p>We peeped about, under the dresser, on the shelves, and snuffed at
the locked door of the larder, but nothing could we discover fit for
food. A jar on a shelf looked tempting enough, but being made, cover and
all, of crockery ware, it defied even our sharp little teeth.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<p>“I’ve made a discovery!” exclaimed I at last, and at my shout the
three other rats came eagerly running towards the place where I stood
rejoicing by a flask of oil.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen that flask a dozen times,” exclaimed one of the Brownies,
in a tone of angry disappointment; “I&nbsp;have longed to taste its
contents, but how is a rat to get at them?”</p>

<p>Here was a puzzler indeed. But Whiskerandos was ever ready at
expedients. With neat dexterity he extracted the stopper; but here the
difficulty did not end, for the neck of the bottle was too narrow by far
to admit the head of a rat; and the position of the flask, in a wooden
box, rendered it impossible to alter its position so as to pour out its
contents.</p>

<p>“Mighty little use that flask is to us!” exclaimed one of the
Brownies, impatiently.</p>

<p>But my clever rat was not easily discouraged In a moment he had
dipped in his long tail, and then whisking it out again, scattered
around a fragrant shower of oil!</p>

<p>There was no end to the praises and commendations which Whiskerandos
received for this simple device. He took little notice of them, however,
and only playfully observed,
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
“It is Ratto who should have thought of this, since nature has furnished
black rats with two hundred and fifty distinct rings in their tails,
while brown ones have only two hundred.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Whiskerandos!” exclaimed I, “this oil is a nice relish to be
sure, but my appetite craves something solid;” and I looked piteously up
at the jar. The other rats looked up piteously also.</p>

<p>“Let us see what we can do!” cried my spirited companion; and he
clambered for the second time up on the shelf on which stood the
tantalizing jar. This time he did not even attempt to nibble at the hard
polished crockery<ins class = "correction" title = ", invisible">,
</ins>he wasted not his energies in any such fruitless endeavour; but,
putting his mighty strength to the task, he pushed the whole jar nearer
and nearer to the edge of the shelf, then over it, till at length it
fell with a tremendous crash which made every one of us leap up high
into the air with amazement!</p>

<p>We might have leapt for joy also, for from the broken crockery what a
feast of delicious dried fruits rolled forth! With what glee we set to
our supper, while Whiskerandos sprang from his shelf, too eager to
partake of the
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
tempting repast to take the slower method of climbing. I must confess
that of all pleasures upon earth there is none to a rat like eating; if
such be the case with any of the lords of creation, why I can only say
that they must be content to be reckoned like rats.</p>

<p>We were in the midst of our feast, our mouths full, and our whiskers
merrily wagging, when we were startled by a faint noise at the kitchen
door. A stealthy sound, as of human feet moving slowly and cautiously
along; a timid hand laid softly on the handle of the door; and then a
whispering murmur of voices. We pricked up our ears and stopped
eating.</p>

<p>“I am sure that the noise came from the kitchen;&mdash;listen!” said
a timorous voice. So those without listened, and so did we within, when
the clock suddenly striking One, made us all start, and so frightened
the Brownies, that off they scampered into their hole. Whiskerandos and
I retreated some steps, and then remained in an attitude of attention,
while again the whispering began.</p>

<p>“Would it not be safer to call in a policeman?”</p>

<p>“No, no,&mdash;my blunderbuss is loaded, and
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
the villains cannot escape. You are nervous&mdash;go back, Eliza.”</p>

<p>“Dearest&mdash;I’ll never leave you to meet the danger alone!”</p>

<p>The handle creaked as it was slowly turned round, and Whiskerandos
exclaiming, “We’d better be off!” followed the example of the Brownies.
Strong curiosity made me linger for a moment, as the door was opened
inch by inch, and I had a glimpse of what to this day I cannot remember
without laughing. One of the lords of the creation slowly advanced
through it, robed in a long red dressing-gown, a candle in one hand, a
loaded blunderbuss in the other, and with a most ludicrous expression on
his pallid face, as though he were making up his mind to kill somebody,
but was a little afraid that somebody might kill him instead! His wife,
looking ghastly in her curl-papers with her eyes and mouth wide open in
fright, was trying to pull him back, and was evidently terrified to
glance round the kitchen, lest some midnight robber should meet her
gaze. Away I scudded, my sides shaking with mirth, leaving the broken
jar and the scattered fruits to tell their own tale, and wondering with
what
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
stories of midnight alarms the valiant husband and his devoted spouse
would amuse their family in the morning.</p>

CHAPTER X.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">THE WANT OF A DENTIST.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">I was</span> glad to see Oddity’s kind ugly
face again in our native shed. How much I had to tell him! how much
older I now felt than one who had never wandered a hundred yards from
his home! Who knows not the pleasure of returning even after a brief
absence, full of information, eager to impart it, and sure of a ready
and attentive listener? I talked over my adventures to my brother, till
any patience but his would have been exhausted; but he was the most
patient of rats, quite willing to have all his adventures second-hand,
without the slightest wish to become a hero, but ready, without a
particle of envy, to admire the exploits of others.</p>

<p>“And how is old Furry?” I asked, when at length I came to the end of
my narration.
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
Furry had now taken up his quarters in the warehouse, but sometimes
visited our shed.</p>

<p>Oddity looked very grave. “You know,” replied he, “that poor Furry
had the misfortune some time ago to lose one of his upper front
teeth.”</p>

<p>“I know it; he struck it out when gnawing at the hoop of a barrel.
But I do not see that the misfortune is great; old Furry has other teeth
left.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> is his misfortune,” added Oddity.</p>

<p>“How?&mdash;what do you mean?&mdash;what does he complain
of,&mdash;losing his teeth or keeping them?”</p>

<p>“Both,” said Oddity. I should have thought him joking, but Oddity was
never guilty of a joke in his life. “You see,” he continued, observing
my look of surprise, “that gnawing is necessary to us rats, to keep down
the quick growth of our teeth. If they are not constantly rubbing one
against another, they soon get a great deal too long for our mouths. As
poor old Furry’s upper tooth is gone, of course the one just under it is
now out of work, and having nothing else to do, is growing at
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
such a pace, that it is actually forming a circle in his mouth!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” I exclaimed “I have often noticed the strange
length of that tooth, but I had no notion of the extent of the
evil.”</p>

<p>“It has much increased since you left us,” sighed Oddity, “and where
it will end I really don’t know. The poor fellow is blind, he had no
pleasure but in nibbling and chatting, and now his dreadful long tooth
is actually locking his jaw.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go to see him?” said I.</p>

<p>“Do as you please,” replied Oddity. “There is little pleasure in
seeing him now, poor fellow.”</p>

<p>And so I found when I went. Poor old Furry’s misfortune had by no
means sweetened his temper. He was ready to bite any one who approached
him, only biting was now out of the question. He could hardly manage to
swallow a little meal which Oddity had procured, and certainly took it
without a sign of gratitude. One would have thought, by his manner
towards the piebald rat, that it was he who had knocked out the unlucky
front tooth, instead of having kindly attended to
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
Furry’s wants for so long, and borne with his temper, which was harder.
But Oddity was, without a doubt, the most patient and steady of rats.
While Bright-eyes, full of fun, made many a joke at the expense of the
blind, crabbed old rat, who had been so fond of talking, and now could
scarcely utter a squeak&mdash;of eating, and now could not nibble a
nut,&mdash;Oddity never thought the sufferings of another the subject
for a smile, or the peevishness and infirmities of age any theme for the
ridicule of the young. He had been often laughed at himself; that was
perhaps the reason why he never gave the same pain to others.</p>

<p>I was really glad to escape back to my shed from the atmosphere of a
peevish temper. I was accompanied to it by Oddity.</p>

<p>“And now, dear old rat,” said I, when we were alone, “how go on our
little ragged friends? What has become of Bob and Billy?”</p>

<p>“They still live, or rather starve, in the old shed,” said he; “but
now they go out each day together. I expect them here every minute.”</p>

<p>“So then they are as poor as ever?” inquired I.</p>

<p>“I have heard something of occasional treats
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
of warm soup at the school, but I don’t think that they get anything
certain. I suppose that now and then, when some good folk sit down to a
comfortable meal, beside a roaring fire, they just happen to remember
that seventy or eighty half-famished children are gathered together in a
street near, and send them a welcome supply. But both Bob and Billy have
hope now, if they have nothing else; they expect soon to be able to do
something for themselves, and to be helped on by the kind friends whom
they have found at the school.”</p>

<p>“Has Bob brought home any more red handkerchiefs with white spots?”
inquired&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>“Not a rag of one,” answered my companion; “but he brings back
something which puzzles my brain&mdash;something white, with black marks
upon it. He and little Billy sit poring over it by the hour. They don’t
eat it, they don’t smell it, they don’t wear it: I can’t make out that
it is of any use to them at all; and yet they seem as much pleased, as
they study it together, as if it were a piece of Dutch cheese!”</p>

<p>“What are these odd things scattered about
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
the shed?” said&nbsp;I; “I&nbsp;don’t remember seeing them before.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I forgot to say the little one is beginning to make baskets, and
neat fingers he has about it: it seems quite a pleasure to the child.
The very talk of the boys is growing different now; the
elder&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped at the sound of a distant cough, which became more
distressing every minute, till our two poor boys entered the shed, and
Bob sank wearily down on the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh! that cough, how it shakes you!” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“Never mind, ’twill be over soon,” gasped his brother.</p>

<p>I was so much surprised at the change in the boys’ appearance, that
at first I could hardly believe my eyes. They both looked much whiter
than I had seen them before; their hair was cut closer, and brushed to
one side, instead of hanging right over their eyes. Neither of the
brothers was in rags; the old worn clothes indeed were still there, but
neatly patched and mended; some one had given Bob a pair of old shoes,
but it was Billy who wore the warm cloak.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<p>“His brother always makes him wear it,” whispered Oddity, “except at
night, and then it covers them both.”</p>

<p>“Now you must have it, Bob; isn’t it comfy?” said the lame child,
pressing the cloak round his brother, whose violent cough for the moment
prevented his reply, and brought a bright colour to his cheek, which I
never had seen there before. “I’ll creep very close to you, Bobby, and
then we’ll both have it, you know. There! are you better now?” he said,
softly, laying his thin cheek against that of his brother.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll ever get better here.” The boy shivered and
closed his eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob! Bob!” cried the child, in accents of fear, “you’re not
a-going to be ill like mother; you’re not a-going to&mdash;die, and
leave me!”</p>

<p>There was something very gentle in the tone, and sweet in the uplift
eye, of the poor destitute boy, as he replied, “I&nbsp;can’t say if I’m
a-going to die, Billy; but don’t you mind what Miss Mary told us about
dying? I used to be afeared when I thought on it, but now&mdash;I think
I could die and be happy!”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<p>“But you must not&mdash;you shall not go and leave me! Oh! what
should I do without you?” cried Billy, bursting into tears.</p>




<h3><a name = "chapXI" id = "chapXI">
CHAPTER XI.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A REMOVAL.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">A manly</span> voice was heard on the
outside, speaking to a porter who was passing at the moment.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, pray, whether two boys of the name of Parton live
near this place? From the direction which was given me, I think that we
must be near their dwelling.”</p>

<p>“Parton?&mdash;well,” began the porter, in a doubtful voice; but
little Billy was up in a moment: “Yes, here they are! here’s where we
live!” shouted he, and the next minute the shed was entered by the
gentleman and his son whom I had seen at the Zoological Gardens.</p>

<p>The father almost started as he glanced round the miserable place,
and the look of pity on his face deepened into one of pain, while Neddy
appeared even more shocked. He had, I suspect, known little of poverty,
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
but by hearsay; and the bare, terrible reality took him by surprise.</p>

<p>Bob had risen from the heap of dirty rubbish which served him for a
bed. His thin cheek glowed with a bright flush of pleasure as he
recognised his benefactor.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you live here?&mdash;sleep here?” exclaimed the
gentleman; “exposed in this wretched shed, without a fire, to all the
severity of winter?”</p>

<p>Bob attempted to speak, but was stopped by his cough. Billy, who was
at all times more talkative and ready to reply, answered, “Yes, we lives
here, and sleeps here too, when the cold don’t keep us awake!”</p>

<p>“And does no one ever come to visit you?”</p>

<p>“No one but the rats!” replied the child.</p>

<p>“The rats!” exclaimed Neddy, with a gesture of horror and disgust,
which irritated my vanity not a little. Oddity had none, so he looked
tranquil as usual.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” cried Neddy, “they must not stay here; this horrible hole
is only fit for rats!”</p>

<p>His father was bending over Bob, feeling his wrist, asking him
questions regarding his
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
health, with a gentle kindness which goes farther to win confidence and
affection than the cold bestowal of the greatest benefits.</p>

<p>“You are not well; you must be cared for, my boy. I think that I
could manage to get you into an hospital; you would have every comfort
there.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” began Bob, and stopped; he looked at his brother, and
then raised his earnest eyes to the face of his new friend, and
gathering courage from the kind glance which he met, faltered forth,
“Please, sir, would they take Billy too?”</p>

<p>The gentleman shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;please, sir, I’d a much rather stay here: we han’t never
been parted, Billy and me.”</p>

<p>I saw Neddy eagerly draw his father aside, very near to my
hiding-place behind the canvass, so that I could hear some of his words,
though they were only spoken in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Could we not get a lodging?&mdash;see here!” He pulled something out
of his pocket, and spoke still lower; but I caught a sentence here and
there: “My Christmas-box, and what aunt gave me, would it be enough?”
his voice was very earnest indeed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<p>I saw something which reminded me of sunshine steal over the father’s
face as he looked down on his blue-eyed boy. Then he replied in a quiet
tone, “Yes, enough to provide one till warmer weather comes. I would
myself see that food and needful comforts were not wanting.”</p>

<p>“And, papa, I have an old suit of clothes; that poor boy is dying
with cold;&mdash;just see, his jacket will hardly hold together. Might I
give him my old suit, papa?”</p>

<p>I read assent in the gentleman’s smile; then, turning to the poor
motherless children, he told them that he could not leave them one night
longer in that miserable place; that he would take them at once to the
dwelling of an honest widow whom he knew, who would watch over the sick,
and take care of the young, for she herself had once been a mother.</p>

<p>Poor Bob, weakened and exhausted by poor living, looked bewildered at
the words, as though he scarcely understood them, but was ready, without
question or hesitation, to go wherever his benefactor should guide him.
One only doubt seemed to linger on his mind. “Shall&nbsp;I,” said he, in
a hesitating tone, “shall
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
I still be able to go to my school?&mdash;’cause I shouldn’t like to be
a-leaving it now!”</p>

<p>“Assuredly you shall attend it, my boy, as soon as your health will
permit. I have no means of permanently assisting you; my stay in England
is but short; I can only give you help for a time. But at the school you
will learn to help yourself, and soon, I hope, be independent of any
human aid. I should do you an injury, and not a kindness, were I to
teach you to rest on others for those means of living which a brave and
honest boy desires to earn for himself. Now let us go on to the
comfortable lodging which I mentioned.”</p>

<p>Billy uttered an exclamation of childish delight, as though the word
had called up before his mind’s eye a warm hearth, a blazing fire, and
smoking viands on a table beside him.</p>

<p>They all now quitted the place, Neddy appearing if possible more
happy than the delighted little child. But Billy was the last to leave
the shed, in which he had passed so many days of suffering and want. He
lingered for a moment at the door, and looked back with a pensive
expression.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<p>“You never wish to see that place again, I am sure?” cried Neddy.</p>

<p>“No, not the place; but&mdash;but I should ha’ just liked a last peep
of the pretty spotted rat who used to lead the old blind un by the
stick!”</p>




<h3><a name = "chapXII" id = "chapXII">
CHAPTER XII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A NEW ROAD TO FAME.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> may have been but my
fancy,&mdash;it probably was so,&mdash;but it seemed to me that Oddity
felt a good deal the departure of his little human friend. I thought
that he missed the lame child who had taken such pleasure in watching
him, and who had found beauties even in his ungainly figure and piebald
skin. It certainly was not that he needed the crumbs which the
half-starved little Billy had stinted himself to throw to him; but I
suppose that it is possible even for rats to grow attached to such as
show them confidence and kindness. I often rallied poor Oddity upon his
melancholy after the boys had been taken away. Bright-eyes told him that
he ought to have been a cat, to sit purring on a mat before the fire,
and lick
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
the hand of some old maiden lady, who would feed him with porridge and
milk. I said that he should be kept in a gentleman’s house, with a bell
round his neck, as rats sometimes are in Germany, to frighten their
brethren away.</p>

<p>Oddity took all our taunts very quietly, nibbled his dinner in the
warehouse, but spent most of his time in the shed; where, as he snuffed
along the ground, and fumbled amongst the chipping and the straw, we
used to say that he was searching for little lame Billy, whom he never
would see any more.</p>

<p>Winter at length passed away. Down the roof of the shed, and through
the hole in it, ran little streams of water from the melted snow. The
west wind blew softly, bending the columns of smoke from the tall
chimneys on shore, and the black funnels of the steamers that went
snorting and puffing down the river.</p>

<p>On one of the first mild days we found poor old Furry dead in the
warehouse. Life had long been a burden to him, which his unhappy temper
rendered yet more galling.</p>

<p>I have heard that the rats of Newfoundland bury their comrades when
they die, laying the bodies neatly one beside another, head and
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
heels placed alternately together. I do not know whether this be true:
it is not the custom of rats in England. We therefore left old Furry
where he lay, close behind a barrel of salt meat, where he was
discovered the next day by one of the men of the warehouse.</p>

<p>Now, if there be one thing which men usually think more worthless
lumber than another, it is the body of a dead rat. Our skins are not in
England collected and valued as they are in France; the only thought is
usually how to get rid of the unpleasant presence of the dead creature.
And yet, strange to say, the porter did not throw away the body of poor
old Furry: he carried it off to his master. I was very curious indeed to
know its fate; and, after many fruitless inquiries, at length I
discovered it.</p>

<p>The tooth which had been Furry’s torment in life, was destined to
make him famous after death. Learned men&mdash;I know not how
many&mdash;examined the head of the rat, looked, wondered, consulted
together; and the end of the matter was, that it was placed as a great
curiosity in some building which is called a museum. There, amidst fine
vases and ancient
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
weapons, old manuscripts and precious stones, and noble busts of the
wise and great, is the head of poor old Furry preserved, with the mouth
wide open, to display the extraordinary tooth! Fame is a strange thing,
after all. I believe that our friend the rat was not the first, nor will
be the last, to pay a heavy price for the bubble!</p>

<p>Early in spring, one sunny morn, I received a visit from my old
comrade Whiskerandos. He was full of life and spirits.</p>

<p>“Ratto,” cried he, “I have often heard you say that you and I should
visit foreign countries together; we’ve a capital opportunity now. A
vessel is to weigh anchor to-morrow. I have been talking to a ship-rat
of my acquaintance, who intends to sail in her, as he has done so
before. He says that she is a capital old vessel, full of first-rate
accommodation for rats; that Captain Blake keeps a very good table; that
there is never any scarcity of pickings; and, in short, I am off for St.
Petersburg, and mean to embark to-night: just say that you will go with
me.”</p>

<p>“I’m your rat!” I exclaimed, highly delighted. “Would there be room
for Oddity too?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<p>“I daresay that there is plenty of room; but&mdash;well, well,
Oddity’s an excellent old fellow in spite of his ugly skin; and I’ll
take care that nobody insults him.”</p>

<p>Off I scampered to Oddity, half out of breath with excitement; and
giving him the news which I had just received, I begged him to accompany
Whiskerandos and myself on a pleasure excursion to Russia.</p>

<p>The piebald one bluntly declined.</p>

<p>“Now this is nonsense, Oddity,” cried I; “you must not stay moping
here any longer, pining after a child, and watching for his return, when
he is never likely to come back.”</p>

<p>“I know he will not come back!” sighed Oddity.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you come and shake off this silly gloom? To tell you
the plain truth, Oddity, your mind really requires opening, and there is
nothing like travelling for that. You are, I am afraid, not a
well-informed quadruped. I insist upon your embarking with us to-night,
and we’ll make a rat of you, my good fellow!”</p>

<p>Oddity shook his head.</p>

<p>“What! you are resolved not to travel?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<p>“Not by water,” was his short reply.</p>

<p>“He is going into the country with me,” cried Bright-eyes, springing
with a few light bounds to my side. “We’re going to my birth-place, near
the sea-side. We will feast amongst the young corn there; and when the
pea-blossom has faded, and the ripe pods hang temptingly down, we’ll
climb up the stalks and shell them, and banquet on the sweet green
seeds! We’ll revel in the strawberry beds, and try which peach is the
ripest! Oh! merry lives lead the rats in a kitchen-garden, beneath the
bright sun of summer!”</p>

<p>“I’ve half a mind to go with you myself,” said I, charmed with the
rural description. But I remembered my engagement with Whiskerandos, and
repressed the rising longing to feast upon English fruits, whose names
sounded so tempting.</p>

<p>“Then farewell, Oddity,” cried I; “I fear I shall never meet you
again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back to the old shed in winter,” said he.</p>

<p>“But I&mdash;ah! where shall I be then? How do I know, once crossing
the sea, whether I shall ever be able to return?” I had not the
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
faintest idea where Russia might be, or what sort of a place I should
find it; whether its rats are black, brown, or white, fierce as the
Hamster, or gentle as Zibethicus. A feeling of misgiving came suddenly
over me; one fear above all others depressed my heart, and unconsciously
I uttered it aloud: “I&nbsp;wonder whether in Russia rats find plenty to
eat!”</p>

<p>The snub face of Oddity grew very grave at a question which he could
not answer, and whose importance he felt. But light-hearted Bright-eyes
quickly relieved our apprehensions.</p>

<p>“If we are to judge of what is in Russia by what comes from it,” he
cried, “I&nbsp;should say that you have little to fear. I examined the
cargo of a Russian ship once, and never did I see a finer collection of
everything that could charm a rat. I say nothing of the
furs,&mdash;skins of all kinds of creatures, sables, black and white
foxes, ermines, lynxes, hyænas, bears, panthers, wolves, martens, white
hares&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop, stop!” I exclaimed, “we do not want any furs beyond those with
which nature has adorned us.”</p>

<p>“There was copper, iron, talc, (a mineral resembling
glass&mdash;)”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<p>“We don’t care about them; no rat ever lived upon minerals.”</p>

<p>“Linen, flax, hemp, feathers&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If there is nothing more nutritious to be had in Russia, why I’d
rather stay at home,” cried&nbsp;I, with a little vexation.</p>

<p>“What do you say, then, to oil, both linseed and train-oil? to
delicious honey, corn without end, soap, isinglass, and, to crown the
whole, hogsheads upon hogsheads of&mdash;tallow!”</p>

<p>“Enough, enough!” I exclaimed with delight, “Russia is the country
for me.”</p>




<h3><a name = "chapXIII" id = "chapXIII">
CHAPTER XIII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">HOW I SET OUT ON MY VOYAGE.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">When</span> the passengers of the Nautilus
went on board, the bright sun was glittering on the water, the whole
river was full of life, covered with vessels of all kinds,&mdash;the
light boat, the lugger, the steamer, with her gaily-coloured
paddle-boxes and long dark stream of smoke; the heavy coal-barge,
scarcely moving at all, sunk down almost to a level with the water: and
there were sounds of all sorts, both from
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
the vessels and the shore&mdash;puffing of steam, dipping of oars,
creaking of rigging, ringing of bells, shouts and calls, and the
sailors’ musical “yo, heave, yo!”</p>

<p>But when we went on board a few hours before, all was comparatively
quiet, though the great pulse of life in London never quite ceases to be
heard, even in the middle of the night. When we crept down to the edge
of the shore, the yellow lamps were gleaming around, and the quiet stars
twinkling above, and the young moon was looking down at her own image
dimly reflected in the river.</p>

<p>“Where is our vessel?” whispered I to Whiskerandos.</p>

<p>“Yonder; don’t you see her black hull?”</p>

<p>“But how are we to get to her?” said I. nervously; “I&nbsp;have no
great mind to swim.”</p>

<p>“Do you mark that dark line that cuts the sky? That is the rope which
fastens her to shore. We will make our way easily along that.”</p>

<p>I had a tolerably intimate acquaintance with ropes, and the feat was
not a difficult one for a rat; and yet&mdash;shall I confess
it?&mdash;my heart quaked a little as I followed my leader across
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
this trembling suspension bridge. I was, however, always unwilling to
show fear in the presence of Whiskerandos, so I concealed even the
relief which I felt when I reached the vessel without a ducking.</p>

<p>It was indeed a delightful home for rats, and many of my race had
thought so, for the number of us on board certainly trebled that of the
sailors. The majority of our brethren in the vessel were ship rats,
whose appearance so much resembled my own that terms of friendship were
at once established between us. The brown rats kept together in quite a
separate part of the ship,&mdash;a wise precaution to avoid the quarrels
and fights which must otherwise have constantly ensued. I consequently
saw less of Whiskerandos during the voyage than I otherwise should have
done.</p>

<p>I managed to establish myself, audacious rat that I was, in Captain
Blake’s own cabin. I knew that it was a spot of danger,&mdash;that much
skill and caution would be required to avoid detection; but I employed
myself industriously in enlarging a small hole, till I had secured for
myself a passage for escape in case I should be discovered, and also the
means of
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
free communication with the other parts of the ship.</p>

<p>I need not describe the cabin more than by saying that it appeared to
be a very snug little place. It held both a swinging-cot and a hammock;
and I examined with great curiosity these and other articles of
furniture, as this was the first opportunity which I had had of
observing how man makes himself comfortable. Assuredly his wants are not
so few nor his requirements so simple as ours.</p>

<p>Early in the day the captain came on board with his son, and after he
had given sundry orders on deck, they both descended to the cabin.
Imagine my surprise when, on their entrance, I recognised my old
acquaintance of the Zoological Gardens, the blue-eyed boy and his
father! I instinctively looked, though in vain, to see if they were
followed by Billy and Bob.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the anchor was weighed, and the vessel began to move.
It was to me a strange and new sensation. I had never before experienced
any motion but that of my own little feet.</p>

<p>Towards evening the motion grew stronger.
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
The vessel heaved up and down, rocked to and fro; the creaking sounds
above grew louder, and were mingled with a constant splashing noise.
Neddy, who had been very merry and active all day, now on deck, now in
the cabin, asking questions, and examining everything upon which he
could lay his hands, appeared now quite heavy and dull. He complained of
headache, and lay down in his hammock. I thought that the boy was ill.
However, he was lively as ever in the morning.</p>

<p>Our sea life was rather a same one, after the first excitement of
starting was over. Neddy spent some hours every day in the cabin, poring
over things which I found were called books. I could not at first
comprehend why, when his eyes were fixed on the pages which to me seemed
exactly alike, he should sometimes look grave, sometimes merry, and
sometimes laugh outright, as though some one were talking with him out
of the book. When, however, his father read aloud to the boy, or he read
aloud to his father, I could imagine why they were amused, though I
never could find out by what means the book could make itself heard. I
have often snuffed round the
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
volumes, and even touched them with my whiskers, but they seemed to me
dead as clay. It must be some wonderful talent, possessed only by man,
which enables him to hear any voice from them.</p>

<p>There was one large volume in particular, which Captain Blake called
“Shakespeare,” from which he sometimes read extracts to his son. I heard
him say once that this very Shakespeare had been dead for more than two
hundred years. Is it not marvellous that his thoughts, preserved in
leaves of paper in some manner inexplicable to a rat, should survive
himself so long,&mdash;that he should make others both laugh and weep
when he himself laughs and weeps no more?</p>

<p>As may be supposed, I took no great interest in the reading until my
ear was caught one evening by an allusion to my own race in Shakespeare,
“Rats, and mice, and such small deer.” We had then a place in the
wondrous volume; this made me all attention, and more than once that
attention was rewarded by hearing of the race of Mus. One mention both
surprised and puzzled me. The rhyme still rests on my memory:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<div class = "verse">
<p>“But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,</p>
<p>And like a rat without a tail,</p>
<p class = "indent">I’ll do&mdash;I’ll do&mdash;I’ll do!”</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>do</i>, of course, represents <i>nibble, nibble, nibble</i>;
but the rat without a tail is of some species of which I had never
before heard, and have certainly never met with.</p>

<p>When Neddy read to his father, it was from a different book; he
called it “History of the French Revolution.” It might have been a
history of my race, for it seemed to be all about rats: democ-rats and
aristoc-rats; “doubtless,” thought&nbsp;I, “tribes peculiar to France.”
Most savage fellows the first seemed to have been&mdash;to our race what
tigers are to cats, still more powerful, bloody, and destructive.
I,&nbsp;like others who jump at conclusions, and do not understand half
of what they hear, had made a ridiculous mistake. My vanity had led me
to over-estimate the importance of my family; but a conversation between
Neddy and his father undeceived me, and made me a sadder and a wiser
rat.</p>

<p><i>Neddy.</i>&mdash;“Well, papa, I fancy that we shall have a great
deal to see at St. Petersburg&mdash;palaces, churches, gardens, all
sorts of sights! But what I most want to see is the czar
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
himself, the great autoc-rat of all the Russias.”</p>

<p>I gave such a start at this, that I dreaded for a moment that I had
betrayed my hiding-place. Here was another rat, and one so singular and
so great, that he was thought more worthy to be seen than all St.
Petersburg besides! I really felt my whole frame swelling with pride;
every hair in my whiskers quivered!</p>

<p>“Is he really so powerful, papa, as people say that he is?”</p>

<p>“Very powerful indeed, my boy.”</p>

<p>“And he’s despotic, is he not? He has no Parliament?”</p>

<p>“No Parliament!” I repeated to myself; “well, that’s no great matter
in a country so abounding with other good things! But what a rat of rats
this must be, to be so spoken of and thought of by the lords of
creation!”</p>

<p>“It must be a fine thing to be an autoc-rat, papa, and have no law
but one’s own will!”</p>

<p>“It is a giddy elevation, Neddy, which no truly wise man, conscious
of human infirmity, would ever covet to attain.”</p>

<p>“Wise man! human infirmity!” exclaimed
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
I. These few words, like a touch to a bubble, had burst my high-blown
ideas of family dignity. It was a man, then, one of human race, who
chose to add rat to his name; and these democ-rats and aristoc-rats in
France&mdash;why, they must be men too, nothing but men, after all!</p>

CHAPTER XIV.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A TERRIBLE WORD.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">When</span> I met my old friend
Whiskerandos, it was usually at night, as moving about by day was
dangerous; for who ever showed mercy to a rat, or even thought of
inquiring whether he possessed qualities which might render him
deserving of it?</p>

<p>“How do you like your quarters?” said Whiskerandos to me one starry
night, when all was still upon deck, and, save one sailor on the watch,
all of humankind were sleeping.</p>

<p>“They please me well enough,” I replied.</p>

<p>“For my part,” said Whiskerandos, “I shall be heartily glad when our
voyage is over; and I am half vexed that I ever led you to make it.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<p>“Why so? We do not fare ill; we have plenty to eat.” As I have
mentioned before, this is ever the first consideration with a rat.</p>

<p>“The sailors don’t starve,” said Whiskerandos more slowly; “yet they
think of adding another dish to their mess.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” said I; “you know that I am curious about dishes,
and should like to have my whiskers in a new one.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but they won’t be contented with your whiskers!” cried my
friend, with a funny, forced laugh.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said I quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, I heard Jack and Tom, two of the sailors, talking together
to-day down in the hold; and there was one word of their conversation
which, I own, struck me like the paw of a cat. That word was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What was it?” cried I nervously; for if a hero like Whiskerandos
felt anything approaching to fear, I might be expected to be half-dead
with fright.</p>

<p>He drooped his head for a moment, and uttered one
word&mdash;“<i>rat-pies!</i>”</p>

<p>I started as though I had seen a tabby pounce down from the
rigging!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<p>“’Tis impossible!” I faintly exclaimed; “human beings never, never
eat rats!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg your pardon!” replied Whiskerandos, regaining his usual
brisk manner; “don’t you remember old Furry telling us that his reason
for quitting China was, that he was afraid of being dished up for the
dinner of some mighty mandarin, whose hair hung in a long tail behind
him? Amongst the lowest classes in France, and the gypsies in England,
we poor rats are known as an article of food; and I have heard that in
the islands of the South Seas we were held in so much esteem, that
‘sweet as a rat’ passed as a proverb.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like such compliments!” exclaimed I, beginning to tremble
all over.</p>

<p>“Come, Ratto, you must pluck up a little courage, and show yourself
worthy of the race of Mus! There is never any use in meeting misfortune
half way. To be caught, killed, and put into a pie, is, I grant it, a
serious evil; to be always afraid of being so is another. The first we
may or we may not escape; but the second&mdash;which is perhaps the
worse of the two&mdash;lies in some degree within the power of our own
will. We need not
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
make ourselves wretched before the time, about some event which never
may happen.”</p>

<p>Good philosophy this, I believe, but not a little difficult to act
upon. When I have seen the younger members of that race which proudly
styles itself “lords of creation,” trembling, shrinking, nay&mdash;I
shame to say it&mdash;even <i>crying</i>, at fear of some possible evil,
a little disappointment perhaps, or a little pain, I have thought of
Whiskerandos and the pies, and fancied that reasoning mortals might
learn something even from a rat.</p>

<p>I was so terribly afraid of being caught by the sailors, that I
confined myself more than usual to the cabin, keeping close to the hole
that I had made, that I might always be ready for a start should the
blue eyes ever happen to rest upon me; but those books, those famous
books, happily gave them other occupation.</p>

<p>“Papa,” said Neddy to his father one day, “I should rather have gone
to some other place than St. Petersburg, I feel such a dislike to the
Russians.”</p>

<p>“Why should you dislike them,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh! because they were our enemies so
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
long, and killed so many of our fine fellows!”</p>

<p>“They were but obeying the orders of their czar&mdash;doing what they
believed to be their duty.”</p>

<p>“But they were horribly cruel, papa.”</p>

<p>“It would both be ungenerous and unjust to charge upon a whole nation
the crimes of a few individuals. It is singular that one of the most
striking examples of mercy to a foe of which I have ever heard, was
shown by a Russian. The story is given as a fact, and I have pleasure in
relating it, not only from its own touching interest, but from the hope
that it may teach my son what our conduct should be towards those who,
though our foes, are our fellow-creatures still.</p>

<p>“In the time of the first Napoleon, the French invaded Russia, from
whence they were obliged to retreat, suffering the most fearful
hardships, not only from the usual privations of war, but those caused
by famine and the fearful cold of that northern clime. Thousands and
thousands of brave troops perished in this fatal retreat. The splendid
army which had marched into Russia so numerous and strong, melted away
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
like a snow-ball! The fierce Cossacks hovered around the lessening
bands, cutting off the weary stragglers who, unable to keep up with the
rest, sank down upon the snow to die!</p>

<p>“At this fearful time two poor French officers, separated from their
comrades, helpless and exhausted, sought refuge at the house of a lady,
beseeching her to preserve them from the terrible death with which they
were threatened, either from cold and hunger, or the swords of their
enemies. The lady was a Russian,&mdash;the officers were her
foes,&mdash;she had probably suffered from the devastating march of the
French army,&mdash;but she had the heart of a woman. She dared not
conceal the officers in her own house for fear of her servants and the
rage of her countrymen, who would probably have not only slain the
fugitives, but have wreaked their vengeance also upon her for seeking to
protect their enemies. The Russian lady hid them in a wood, at some
little distance from her dwelling, and thither every night, braving both
the danger of discovery and the peril of being attacked by wolves, did
this noble-hearted woman go alone, to bear food and necessaries to the
suffering Frenchmen.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<p>“Oh! papa, just fancy hurrying along the snow, with the sharp
winter’s wind cutting like a knife,&mdash;and then perhaps to hear a
distant howl, showing that a wolf was on one’s track! Oh! I should not
have fancied those night expeditions!”</p>

<p>“It would have been noble,” resumed the captain, “to have ventured
thus for a friend,&mdash;the Russian lady did so for her enemies.”</p>

<p>“And were the French officers saved at last?”</p>

<p>“Yes; by freely giving her money as she had freely risked her safety,
after a while the lady contrived the escape of the fugitives beyond the
frontier. When a considerable time had elapsed, a present of a piece of
plate, which she received from France, showed that the officers were not
ungrateful to their preserver.”</p>

<p>“She was a generous enemy, papa, and a noble woman. But are not the
common people in Russia very ignorant and bad?”</p>

<p>“Very ignorant I believe they are, but it would be harsh and wrong to
call them very bad. They are cheerful and good-tempered, and even when
intoxicated they do not show
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
the ferocity which disgraces a drunkard in England.”</p>

<p>“But are they not dreadful thieves?”</p>

<p>“They are said to be very skilful in cheating, and singularly
dexterous in picking pockets. But here again it would be unjust to brand
a whole nation with a disgraceful stigma.<a class = "tag" name = "tag4"
id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> I have another true story for you,
Neddy, and this time it shall be of a poor Russian, a messenger, or as
they call him, an Isdavoi.</p>

<p>“An English lady living at St. Petersburg gave five hundred rubles<a
class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> in charge
to an Isdavoi to deliver to her daughter, who dwelt at some distance. On
the following day the Russian returned, kissed the lady’s hand after the
fashion of his country, and said, ‘Pardon me, I am guilty. I cannot tell
how it has happened, but I have lost your money, and cannot find it
again. Deal with me as you please.’”</p>

<p>“The poor fellow,” continued the captain, “probably expected a severe
flogging, or dismissal from his office, but the lady had no
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
inclination to punish him with such rigour. Unwilling to ruin the
Isdavoi, she made no mention of his offence, considered the money as
gone for ever, and after a while lost sight of the messenger entirely.
After six years had elapsed he came to her one day with a joyful face,
laden with six hundred rubles, which he brought in the place of those
which had been intrusted to his care. On inquiry it was found that this
honest Russian had for those six years been denying himself every little
pleasure, and by resolute economy had saved up his wages until he had
collected about half of the sum required. He had then married a wife
whose feelings of honour appeared to have been as delicate as his own,
for not only her dower of one hundred rubles was added to his
hard-earned savings, but her little valuables had been sold to make up
the full amount of the money that had been lost!”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! what honest people! But did the English woman take all
their money!”</p>

<p>“No entreaties on her part could induce the poor Isdavoi to take back
the rubles to save up which had been for so long the object of his life.
The lady, however, generously
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
placed the money in a public bank to accumulate for the benefit of his
children.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” exclaimed Neddy, clapping his hands; “that was just how a
lady should behave; and as for the poor Isda&mdash;what do you call
him?&mdash;he was a fine fellow, and quite worthy to have been an
Englishman!”</p>

CHAPTER XV.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">FIRST VIEW OF ST. PETERSBURG.</span></h3>


<p>“<span class = "firstword">Cronstadt!</span> Cronstadt!” I heard the
shout from the deck one evening when the sun was going down, and his red
disk seemed resting on the heaving waters, while to the east the strong
fortifications stood clearly defined against the sky, bathed in his
glowing light. Being quite alone in the cabin, for every human being was
on deck, I was taking my survey of the place from the open port-hole
before me.</p>

<p>It was a very gay scene upon which I looked. Not even on the Thames,
our own river, have I seen a greater variety of craft. Steam-boats, and
sailing-boats, schooners, cutters, brigs and gondolas,&mdash;paddled
along
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
the water, or spread snowy wings to the breeze. I gazed upon them, and
upon the formidable batteries, bristling with guns, which defend the
“water-gate of St. Petersburg” as Cronstadt has been called, till the
shadows of night fell around, and I could without risk of observation,
join Whiskerandos in the hold.</p>

<p>He was in company with another rat, of rather a foreign
appearance.</p>

<p>“My friend Dwishtswatshiksky here,” said he, “tells me that we shall
soon arrive at the capital of Russia.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it!” cried I; “I long to be again on shore.
If we had any means of landing here, I should not care if I stopped
short of St. Petersburg.” I had not forgotten the pies.</p>

<p>“You would doubtless, little brother, from natural association, like
to visit Rat Island,” said the stranger with the unpronounceable
name.</p>

<p>“Rat Island!” exclaimed Whiskerandos and I at the same moment.</p>

<p>“That fortified island opposite to Cronstadt, lying across the bay
upon which the place stands, and giving to its waters the appearance
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
of a lake, was called Ratusare, or Rat’s Island in the days of old.”</p>

<p>“Not the only Rat’s Island in the world,” observed Whiskerandos; “we
have one off the coast of Devon.”</p>

<p>“And doubtless it still bears that name,” said the Russian rat, with
a graceful wave of his whiskers. “But things, alas! were altered here
when the warriors of Peter the Great drove the Swedes from this island
in 1703. The vanquished left behind them nothing but a great kettle,
which in default of other trophy the Russians reared in triumph on a
pole; so the name of the place has been changed since that time, and Rat
Island is called Kettle Island.”</p>

<p>“It is fortunate for us, sir rat,” said I, (I&nbsp;did not venture to
attempt to call him by his name,) “it is fortunate for us that before
landing in a strange country, we have met with a friend so intelligent
and well-informed as you appear to be.”</p>

<p>He made me so many polite assurances of the gratification which he
felt in making my acquaintance, the pleasure which it would give him to
conduct us to the house in which he usually quartered in the city, and
the pride
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
which he would feel in showing us everything which he could hope would
interest us, that we blunt English rats felt almost abashed at his
excessive courtesy. He only followed the manners of his country, where
the poorest labourer is quite overwhelming in his politeness.</p>

<p>Dwishtswatshiksky (we soon shortened his name to Wisky) was as good
as his word. We kept close while the passengers landed at a magnificent
quay at St. Petersburg; while the rapid tread of feet, loud voices,
shouts and hurried movements, were heard above, not a rat ventured forth
from his hiding-place. Alas! with every precaution, when we mustered
before landing, our numbers were sadly diminished, though of rat pies we
had heard no more. In darkness we a second time made a suspension bridge
of the rope which bound the vessel to the shore, and with delight I
found myself again upon land, a free denizen of earth, no longer cooped
up in the narrow, dangerous prison of a vessel.</p>

<p>Wisky led the way, closely followed by Whiskerandos. They moved on so
fast that I was in danger of losing sight of my guides, so apt
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
was I to linger on my way to look at the wonders around me. It is a
beautiful city, St. Petersburg; at least so it seemed to me in the
moonlight. With its streets of palaces, its lively green roofs, sky-blue
cupolas dotted with stars, gilt spires, columns, statues, and obelisks,
it is a place not soon to be forgotten. If I might venture to suggest a
fault, it is that all looks too perfectly new. Antiquity gives added
interest to beauty,&mdash;at least such is the opinion of a rat. That
which looks as if it had risen but yesterday, appears as though it might
fall to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Would you believe it,” said Wisky, “a great part of this splendid
city is built upon piles! The foundation alone of yonder great church
cost a million of rubles! There is a constant fight going on here
between water and the efforts of man. To look at the fine buildings
around us, you would say that man had secured the victory. He has thrown
over the river a variety of bridges, stone, suspension, and pontoon,
that can be taken to pieces at pleasure, to connect the numerous islands
together, and has raised the most stately edifices on a trembling bog!
But the water is not
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
conquered after all! I have known houses burst asunder from the
foundations giving way. I have seen a palace separated from the very
steps that led up to its door. And in spring, when the snow melts which
has been collecting for months, the horses can scarcely flounder along
through the rivers of mud in the streets!”</p>

<p>“Does the water ever rise very high?” inquired Whiskerandos. This was
no idle question on his part; he made it as a practical rat, who knew
what it was to live in a cellar, and had no desire to be drowned.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear brother!” replied the Russian rat, “many stories are
still told of the fearful inundation which happened in 1824. Impelled by
a furious west wind, the waters then rose to a fearful height, streamed
through the streets, floated the carriages, made boats of the carts,
nay, lifted some wooden houses right from the ground, and sent them
floating about, with all their inhabitants in them, like so many
men-of-war! Horses were drowned, and so, alas! were rats in terrible
numbers. The trees in the squares were crowded with men, clinging to
them like bees when they cluster!
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
It is said that thousands of poor human beings perished, and that the
inundation cost the city more than a hundred millions of rubles!”</p>

<p>“Well, St. Petersburg is a splendid place!” cried&nbsp;I; “but after
all, the merry banks of the Thames, and dear dingy old London for
me!”</p>




<h3><a name = "chapXVI" id = "chapXVI">
CHAPTER XVI.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A RUSSIAN KITCHEN.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">Under</span> the guidance of Wisky we took
up our abode in a Russian house. House did I call it!&mdash;if ever
there was a palace this was one. We established ourselves in the
kitchen; a warm, comfortable place we found it, where we had much
opportunity for observation, both of the denizens of the place and their
various occupations.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Wisky,” said I, on the night following that of our
arrival, “that there is no end to the number of servants that pass in
and out of this dwelling! Who is that fellow in the blue cloth caftan,
fastened under his left arm with three silver buttons, and girded round
the waist with a coloured silk
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
scarf? His fine bushy beard seems to match the fur with which his high
four-cornered cap is trimmed.”</p>

<p>“That is the Tartar coachman,” replied Wisky; “a&nbsp;dashing fellow
is he, and a bold driver through the crowded streets of the city. The
pretty youths yonder are the postilions. Young and small they must be,
to suit the taste of a Russian noble. The worse for them, poor boys, as
they are less able to endure the bitter cold of a winter’s night, when,
if they drop asleep on their horses, they are never likely to awake any
more!”</p>

<p>“And are their masters actually cruel enough,” I exclaimed, “to
expose them to such suffering and risk?”</p>

<p>“My much esteemed brother,” replied the Russian rat, “doubtless your
clear mind has already come to the conclusion that selfishness is
inherent in the human race. A young noble is at a ball; must he quit its
bright enchantments, and the society of the fair whom he admires,
because a bearded coachman is freezing without? A beauteous lady,
wrapped in ermine and velvet, is weeping in the theatre over the woes of
some imaginary heroine; would you
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
have her dry her tearful eyes, and leave the scene of touching interest
and elegant excitement, because icicles are hanging from the locks of
her little postilion, and his head is gradually sinking on his breast,
as the fatal sleep steals over him? Selfish!&mdash;yes, all human beings
are selfish!”</p>

<p>“There are exceptions to that rule,” thought I, for I remembered the
stories which I had heard in the cabin; and I also recollected the
conduct of their narrator, Captain Blake, towards the starving little
thief in London.</p>

<p>“I have been trying,” said Whiskerandos, “to count the servants in
this house; but no sooner do I think that my task is done, than in comes
some new one, speaking some different language, wearing some different
costume, and puts all my calculations to fault.”</p>

<p>“It would puzzle even one possessing the talents of my brother to
count the number of the servants here,” replied Wisky. “Why,
even&nbsp;I, who, before my visit to England, spent months amongst the
household, can scarcely number them now. To begin with the inmates of a
higher rank, who never appear in the kitchen, there are the French
governess and
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
the German tutor, to polish up the minds of the children, and the family
physician to look after their health. Then there are the superintendent
of accounts, the secretary, the dworezki&mdash;he who has charge of the
whole establishment, the valets of the lord, the valets of the lady, the
overseer of the children, the footmen, the buffetshik or butler, the
table-decker, the head groom, the coachman and postilions of the lord,
the coachman and postilions of the lady,&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Whiskerandos, “are their carriages so small that they
will not hold two, or are the grandees afraid of quarrelling, that
husband and wife cannot travel together!”</p>

<p>“Surely, Sir Wisky,” exclaimed I, “you must have come to the end of
your list!”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, little brother, not yet. There are the attendants on the
boys and on the tutor, the porter, the head cook and the under cook, the
baker, brewer, the waiting-maids and wardrobe-keeper of the lady, the
waiting-maid who attends the French governess, the nurses that take care
of the children, and the nurses that once took care of the children, the
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
kapell-meister or head musician, and all the men of his band!”</p>

<p>“Well!” cried I, much amused, “at any rate a Russian noble must be
well served. If he calls for his shoes, I suppose that half-a-dozen
servants start off in a race to fetch them, and knock their heads
together in their eagerness to get them!”</p>

<p>A valet at this moment entered the kitchen, where, secure in our
hiding-place, we were watching all that passed.</p>

<p>“Where’s Ivan?” said he, “where’s Ivan?” The coachman, who was
playing at draughts with the head groom, looked up for an instant, then
silently made his move.</p>

<p>“My lady’s a-fainting, and my lord’s calling for water! Where’s Ivan,
I say? ’tis his business to fetch it.”</p>

<p>“There’s Ivan,” said the cook, pointing contemptuously to a
sandy-haired figure fast asleep under the table.</p>

<p>“Get up, ye lazy fellow!” exclaimed the valet; “my lady’s fainting,
my lord’s calling for water; take a glass of it on a silver salver
directly.”</p>

<p>Ivan got up slowly, yawned, stretched himself,
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
rubbed his eyes; then, taking a tumbler off the dresser, he leisurely
filled it with water.</p>

<p>“And where am I to get the silver salver?” said he.</p>

<p>“That’s in keeping of Matwei the buffetshik,” observed the
table-decker.</p>

<p>“And where is Matwei to be found?”</p>

<p>“Here you, Vatka,” pursued the valet, turning to another attendant,
who was busy over his basin of kwas, “go you to Matwei and tell him that
we want a silver salver on which to carry a tumbler, for my lady’s
fainting up stairs, and my lord is calling for water.”</p>

<p>A loud ring from above was heard, as if to enforce the order. “Sei
tshas! sei tshas!&mdash;directly, directly!” called out Vatka; but he
nevertheless finished his kwas, and wiped his mouth before he went to
Matwei the butler to procure the silver salver on which Ivan the footman
would carry the tumbler of water which Paul the valet had been ordered
to bring.</p>

<p>Before all was ready another messenger came to tell Ilia the bearded
coachman to put to the horses, for the lady was ready for her drive. It
was evident that she had managed to recover from her fainting fit
without the aid
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
of the glass of water,&mdash;a happy thing for one who had the
misfortune to keep fifty or sixty servants.</p>

<p>Wisky laughed at my look of surprise. “I believe that one pair of
hands,” said he, “often serve better than a dozen. The Russian proverb
says that ‘directly’ means <i>to-morrow morning</i>, and ‘this minute’
<i>this day week</i>.”</p>

<p>With quiet night came our feasting-time<ins class = "correction"
title = ", invisible">, </ins>and when the kitchen was deserted by the
crowds of servants, Whiskerandos, Wisky, and&nbsp;I, crept softly out of
our hole, provided with pretty sharp appetites for our meal.</p>

<p>“I am curious to taste that liquor which you call kwas,” said&nbsp;I;
“Vatka seemed to relish it exceedingly.”</p>

<p>“Relish it, brother! I should think so!” exclaimed Wisky. “Kwas is to
a Russian what water is to a fish; rich or poor could hardly bear
existence without it.”</p>

<p>“Not bad at all,” said I, dipping my whiskers carefully into a bowl
that had been set aside by the cook.</p>

<p>“Mind you don’t tumble in, old fellow!” cried Whiskerandos, “and be
drowned in kwas
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
as I have heard that a duke once was drowned in wine.”</p>

<p>“And what may this kwas be made of?” inquired I, after another
approving sip.</p>

<p>“I ought to know, little brother,” replied Wisky, “for many and many
a time have I seen it brewed. A pailful of water is poured into an
earthen jar, into which are shaken two pounds of barley-meal, half a
pound of salt, and a pound and a half of honey. The whole is then placed
in an oven with a moderate fire, and constantly stirred. It is left for
a time to settle, and in the morning the clear liquor is poured off. In
a week it is in the highest perfection.”</p>

<p>“I wonder that kwas is not made in England,” observed&nbsp;I; “but
honey is not so plentiful there.”</p>

<p>“Sugar would make a good substitute, I should think,” said Wisky;
“the beverage would not then be an expensive one. But here is our
beloved Whiskerandos busy with his shtshee, the dish of all dishes in
this country, that which nothing, I believe, could ever drive from the
table or the heart of a Russian. When in a foreign land, it is said, it
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
is not the remembrance of native hills or plains, or the tender delights
of home, that draws tears into an exile’s eyes, but the loss of his
beloved shtshee, the favourite dish of his childhood.”</p>

<p>“Leave a little for me!” I cried eagerly to Whiskerandos, who had
nearly finished, by dint of steady perseverance, a portion which had
been left in a plate. “Why,” I added, as I tasted the liquid, “this
seems to me simply cabbage soup!”</p>

<p>“Whatever my brother may think of it,” observed Wisky, dipping his
whiskers into the nearly empty plate, “he is now tasting that which
forms the principal article of food of forty millions of human beings!
Better live without bread than without shtshee.”</p>

<p>“And the ingredients?” said I, for I always delighted to pick up any
scrap of information interesting to a rat.</p>

<p>“There are almost as many ways of making shtshee as of cooking
potatoes. I have seen six or seven cabbages chopped up small, half a
pound of butter, a handful of salt, and two pounds of minced mutton
added, the whole mixed up with a can or two of kwas. But it is now time,
brothers, for us to sally forth.
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
I must do the honours of this our city, and show my illustrious guests
whatever I may deem worthy of their observation.”</p>

CHAPTER XVII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A RAMBLE OVER ST. PETERSBURG.</span></h3>


<p>“<span class = "firstword">What</span> a nation of painters Russia
must be!” exclaimed&nbsp;I, as we quietly moved through the silent
streets. Every shop had a picture before it, expressive of the
occupation of its owner. Here was a tempting board covered with
representations of every loaf and roll that a painter’s fancy could
devise; there a tallow-chandler did his best to make candles appear
picturesque. Even from the second and third floors hung portraits of
fiddles, and flutes, boots, shoes, caps, bonnets, and bears’ grease, and
on one board a sad likeness of a rat in a trap made us quicken our steps
as we passed it.</p>

<p>We moved through a deserted market. Here whole lanes are devoted to
the sale of a single kind of article. There is the stocking row, the
shoe row, the hat row, at which it appeared
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
that a whole nation might have provided covering for head and for
feet.</p>

<p>“I wish, dear brother,” said Wisky, “that your visit had been in the
season of winter. I could then have led you to a market which strangers
must indeed have surveyed with surprise. You would then have seen
beasts, fishes, and fowls, all frozen so hard that the hatchet is
required to divide them. You would have passed through rows of dead
sheep standing upon their feet, motionless oxen that seemed ready to
low, whole flocks of white hares appearing actually in motion, reindeer
and elks on whose mighty horns the pigeons fearlessly perch!”</p>

<p>“The cold must then be fearful in winter,” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh! the houses are kept so warm with stoves that there but little
suffering is known. But woe to the men who loiter in the streets when
they are paved with ice and glistening with snow! The passengers run for
their lives, with the sharp wind rushing after them, as a cat after a
mouse! Men cover even their faces with fur; but should an unlucky nose
peep out from the warm shelter, the bitter
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
frost often bites it on a sudden. “Father&mdash;father! thy nose!” thus
will one stranger salute another as he passes; and if not speedily
rubbed with snow, the nose of the poor passenger is lost! Men’s very
eyes are sometimes frozen up, and they have no resource but to beg
admission at the first door to which they can grope, to unthaw their
glued lashes at a stove!”</p>

<p>“All this is very curious,” observed I, “but still I have little
desire to witness it. The long winter must be dreary indeed!”</p>

<p>“The Russians are lively fellows,” observed Wisky, “and instead of
grumbling at dark skies and piercing blasts, they make merry where
others would murmur. When winter must perforce be their companion, they
oblige the grim old giant to add to their amusements. You should see the
gay sledges as they dash at full speed over the frozen surface of the
River Neva! and the ice-mountains which the people raise, and down which
they glide swift as lightning, laughing, shouting, and singing! I have
seen snow piled up to the very roof of a house; and down its steep
slope, merely seated on a mat, a large merry party glide
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
gaily to the ground. But,” he cried, suddenly interrupting himself,
“have a care where you tread, my brother, or you will be down into that
ice-pit! Never was there such a place as St. Petersburg for
these,&mdash;no large house is deemed complete without one. If Russians
<i>cannot</i> be without abundance of ice in winter, they show that they
<i>will</i> not be without it during their brief hot summer,&mdash;the
quantities consumed could scarcely be believed!”</p>

<p>Whiskerandos, who had been lingering behind us, in a tempting quarter
of the market, now scampered up and joined us. We were passing at the
time a large building, and I could not avoid looking up in wonder at its
strange columns. Of these there were no fewer than a hundred, and the
capital of each was formed by three cannon, with their round open mouths
yawning down into the street.</p>

<p>“This,” said our guide, following the direction of my eyes, “is the
Spass Preobrashenskoi Sabor; a church greatly adorned with the spoils of
nations vanquished by Russia.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Whiskerandos, who in the course of his adventurous life
had both seen cannon and learnt their use<ins class = "correction" title
= "text has . for ,">, </ins>“perhaps those
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
big instruments of war are just as well up there, where they are seen,
and not heard or felt. Man is the only creature, I fancy, who, not
content with what powers of destruction nature has given him, cuts down
trees from the forest, digs iron from the mine, sets the furnace
glowing, and the engine working, to fashion means of killing his
brothers in a wholesale manner.”</p>

<p>“Yonder,” said Wisky, pointing with his nose, “are the father of the
Russian fleet and the grandmother of the houses of St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see them by all means!” I exclaimed; “I have viewed plenty of
Russian ships and Russian houses, and I have a lively curiosity to see
the father and the grandmother of so famous a family!”</p>

<p>Wisky rapidly led the way to a hut, into which with little difficulty
we entered, for locks and bars do not keep out rats, nor surly porters
refuse them admission.</p>

<p>“Is this the father of the Russian fleet!” exclaimed Whiskerandos
rather contemptuously, running, audacious rat that he was, along the
edge of a boat about thirty feet long. “Is
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
Russia a child, that she should amuse herself with a toy, and keep a big
boat under a roof where there is no water to float it, as if it were
some delicate jewel!”</p>

<p>“On no jewel in the Emperor’s crown,” replied Wisky, “would a Russian
look with the same interest as on that poor boat. Peter the Great helped
to fashion it himself! He found his country without a navy, and he gave
her one; he laboured himself as a common ship-wright: and now, as a
mighty oak springs from a single acorn, in that one boat his people view
with reverence “The father of the Russian fleet<ins class = "correction"
title = "no second ”">.”</ins></p>

<p>“And where is the grandmother of the houses?” inquired&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>“That is hard by,” replied Wisky. “It is nothing but a small wooden
cottage which Peter built for himself by the Neva, before a single
street stretched across the dreary bog upon which he founded this city
of palaces!”</p>

<p>And so we rambled on, light-hearted rats that we were, picking up
scraps here and there, and exchanging observations, till a faint blush
in the eastern sky warned us that it was time to go home. Before we
reached the house
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
already criers were abroad in the streets, screaming, “Boots from
Casan!”&mdash;“Pictures from Moscow!”&mdash;“Flowers, fine flowers!” as
they wandered on, carrying their wares on their heads. Fierce-looking
fellows, with long shaggy hair and beards, wrapped up in skins were
passing about, exchanging good-natured greetings, strangely in contrast
with their appearance. “Good-day, brother! how goes it? what is your
pleasure? how can I serve you?” Smiling, bowing, baring their rough
heads to each other, these poor Russians appeared the very pictures of
politeness shrouded in sheepskin. But remembering that even amongst the
most civilized nations of the world, rats are considered as quite beyond
the pale of courtesy, and that the most good-natured Musjik in this city
would have thought nothing of hitting one of us over with his shoe, we
thought it better to retreat while our skins were whole, and regain our
comfortable quarters in the kitchen.</p>




<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<h3><a name = "chapXVIII" id = "chapXVIII">
CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">HOW WE WERE TRANSPORTED.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> was my intention, as well as that
of Whiskerandos, after hearing of the cheerfulness of a Russian winter,
and the comfort preserved in the houses, to remain to witness the
ice-mountains, the frozen Neva, and, above all, the wonderful market
which Wisky had described to us on that night.</p>

<p>Our intentions, however, were frustrated, and our projects of
amusement defeated by an incident which suddenly altered the whole
course of our affairs.</p>

<p>Whiskerandos, who was of a very bold and independent disposition,
cared not to place himself constantly under the guidance of his Russian
companion. He made forays by himself into the streets, moon or no moon,
it was all one to him. He brought us back accounts of many singular
adventures,&mdash;how he had been seen by a dog, chased by a cat, and
nearly run over by a drosky, the name given to the vehicles which in St.
Petersburg take the place of our London cabs.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<p>“Have a care, brother, have a care! Even the brave may dare too much,
and the fortunate venture once too often!” with such exclamations as
these our courteous Russian rat would listen to the tales of such
hair-breadth escapes.</p>

<p>The effect of his words upon me was to render me
cautious,&mdash;timid perhaps you will call it. The only motives which
usually roused me to encounter danger, were hunger, or overpowering
curiosity. I liked to see all, hear all, and know all, and picked up
scraps of general information with the same relish that I would have
picked up scraps of cheese.</p>

<p>Once Whiskerandos came home in high spirits. He had made such a
discovery, found such treasures,&mdash;been in the very place where of
all others a rat might rejoice in boundless content.</p>

<p>Directly behind the Exchange he had found a large open space, fenced
round with iron railing, which, while keeping out man, offered
everywhere a door of welcome to rats. Here, protected by nothing but
tarpaulin, was collected a quantity of goods, both those which had been
imported into Russia, and those with
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
which she paid back from her own productions the contributions of the
world.</p>

<p>“Oh, the mountains of tallow which I saw there!” exclaimed
Whiskerandos, executing a somerset in the air, in the excess of his
admiration and delight.</p>

<p>“There may well be mountains, brother,” observed Wisky, “since,
besides the quantities which she uses herself, Russia is said to export
every year about <i>two hundred and fifty millions of pounds</i> of
tallow, of which above one half is shipped from St. Petersburg<ins class
= "correction" title = "” missing">.”</ins></p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty millions!” I exclaimed, almost breathless with
amazement, “why, surely that is enough to light up the whole world, and
feast every rat that is in it! I would give anything to see the place
where such glorious mountains are to be found<ins class = "correction"
title = "printed as shown: may be error for !">?”</ins></p>

<p>“Trust yourself with me to-morrow night, and I will guide you to the
place,” said Whiskerandos.</p>

<p>Now commenced a conflict in my mind, caution pulling me one way,
curiosity the other, while a discussion took place between my comrades,
Wisky backing caution, Whiskerandos
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
curiosity,&mdash;and the English rat won the day.</p>

<p>So that night off we two scampered together, and without accident or
adventure reached the space at the back of the Exchange. Truly I was in
a world of wonders! I actually revelled in everything that can charm the
palate or the nose of a rat! Here was the division for Russian
imports,&mdash;various and curious were they. There were chests of tea
from China, coffee from Arabia, sugar from the West Indies, and English
cotton goods, bales on bales piled up to a marvellous height. There was
a quantity of tobacco, heaps of cheese, spices of all sorts and kinds.
Now we came upon the odour of cinnamon or cloves; then the strong
perfume of musk betrayed an importation from India.</p>

<p>No wonder that the hours passed unheeded while we lingered in this
wonderful place! We passed on to the portion of the area devoted to
Russian exports, and here we were, if possible, still more delighted!
All the articles which Bright-eyes had mentioned as coming from Russia
were here; we were bewildered amongst heaps of furs, piles of
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
leather, barrels of tallow, and prodigious quantities of corn! Morn was
breaking, indeed, but we could not tear ourselves away, till the sounds
of life, and the signs of motion around us, alarmed me with the idea
that it was too late to retreat.</p>

<p>“Let’s bury ourselves in this corn-sack,” cried I, “we can sleep here
very well during the day, and recommence our explorations after
dark.”</p>

<p>Whiskerandos acceded to my proposition. Quiet we kept, very quiet.
Noisier the world seemed to grow, till at length voices were heard so
alarmingly near, that I crouched closer to my companion in terror!</p>

<p>Then&mdash;oh! the horrible sensation which I
experienced,&mdash;never shall I forget it! I felt that our sack was
roughly pushed by some one, then suddenly lifted on high!</p>

<p>“We are lost!” I gasped to Whiskerandos. Then another sort of motion
succeeded, accompanied by a heavy rumbling sound, like that of the
rolling wheel of a truck. Every hair of mine quivered with fear!</p>

<p>“Whiskerandos! oh, Whiskerandos! if they should be carrying us to a
mill!&mdash;if we should
<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
be ground into powder between two great stones!”</p>

<p>“Be quiet and never despair,” was the answer of the bold-hearted
rat.</p>

<p>I believe that that terrible journey did not last long, but to me the
time appeared an age! Every turn of the grating wheel beneath me sent a
pang of anguish through my frame! At last the truck, if such it were,
stopped; in a few minutes the sack was again rudely moved, carried
aloft, and then tumbled, with its living contents,
down&mdash;down&mdash;we could not tell where!</p>

<p>What a shock it gave me, that tumble! I lay for some seconds quite
stunned. My first impulse, when I recovered a little, was bitterly to
bewail my condition, and to reproach him who had brought me into it.</p>

<p>“Oh that I had been content with my kwas and my shtshee! Oh that I
had never left the kitchen! that I had never ventured forth with a
reckless companion, who would, I believe, play at hide and seek with a
cat, or nibble at the pocket of a rat-catcher!”</p>

<p>My tone was, I knew, both peevish and provoking; and many a brown
rat, in the
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
position of my companion, would have stopped my doleful squeaking at
once by giving me something to squeak for. But Whiskerandos, whatever
were his faults, was above that mean one of quarrelling with those who
found them out, or attempting to screen and defend them.</p>

<p>“Ratto, I am sorry that I have led you into trouble,” said he.
“I&nbsp;wish that I could suffer alone for my self-will and imprudence.
But since no regrets can recall the past, let us not make our miseries
greater by reproaches and dissension between those who may soon die, as
they have lived, together.”</p>

<p>His mildness quite overcame any feeling of bitterness in my heart;
and hope revived as some time elapsed without fresh cause for alarm
occurring.</p>

<p>“I wonder where we are!” exclaimed I, shaking myself into a more easy
position.</p>

<p>“I fancy that I hear the creaking of a windlass!” cried
Whiskerandos.</p>

<p>“And the flapping of canvass!” added I. “And I smell tar.”</p>

<p>“A strong odour of tar! Depend upon it, we are down in the hold of a
ship!”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<p>“Ha! that’s the ripple of water! she moves,&mdash;she moves!”</p>

<p>We were again afloat on the waters!</p>




<h3><a name = "chapXIX" id = "chapXIX">
CHAPTER XIX.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A STORM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</span></h3>


<p>“<span class = "firstword">Farewell</span> St. Petersburg, stately
city! with thy flat green roofs, and star-spangled domes! Farewell
merry-hearted, sandy-haired Russians, bearded Tartars, gay
Circassians,&mdash;never may we behold you again! Farewell kwas and
shtshee, and all the luxuries for too brief a time enjoyed! Where are we
going now,&mdash;where!”</p>

<p>Such were the complaints which I was wont to pour out during the long
tedious voyage which succeeded. Whiskerandos never grumbled, it was not
in his nature; he quietly fed on his corn without uttering one
melancholy word: but I suspected that he, like myself, associated
sailors with rat pies; and to hear any one approach the hold, drove me
almost wild with terror.</p>

<p>That was a horrible voyage! A fearful
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
tempest came on before the vessel readied the place of her destination,
whatever that might be. The winds whistled and raged, and the ship
reeled and plunged like a restive horse; and again and again torrents of
salt water came sweeping down into the hold! Then, as the furious storm
continued, the very seams of the ship seemed to open like pores, to let
in the sea, which was knocking and raging without for admittance, till
at length the hold became like a ditch, which we rats could not cross
but by swimming!</p>

<p>Then the pumps were set to work&mdash;I could hear the men toiling at
them day and night; yet the water gained on them notwithstanding their
efforts. There were tremendous noises on deck; I fancied once or twice
that I could distinguish human cries; and what with the constant
splashing of the water as the vessel rolled heavily from side to side,
and the bumping and thumping of some casks that had got loose, and were
smashing against one another, and the shouting, and the roaring of wind
and waves, there was enough to stun and terrify any creature, be he
quadruped or biped!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<p>Such of the corn as remained in our sack was becoming so soft from
salt water that it had acquired the consistence of a pudding. But we had
now no heart even to eat!</p>

<p>We had so often heard the captain’s voice raised to give loud orders,
that we had ceased to pay any particular attention to them, little
dreaming that any would concern us further than as they regarded the
safety of the vessel. But at length the result of an order to lighten
the ship was speedily felt in the hold! Our sack (for we still made it
our hiding-place) was suddenly lifted with others; and before we had
time even to guess what was intended, splash we went into the sea!</p>

<p>Ugh! how the water bubbled in our ears! What frantic efforts we made
to free ourselves from the sack! Nor were those efforts without success,
for we had long ago gnawed the string which fastened its mouth: it
opened with the motion of the waves, and corn, rats and all, floated
upon the surface of the raging billows!</p>

<p>Down in two seconds went the corn, swallowed up by the sea; still we
struggled, drowning rats that we were, to save ourselves
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
by desperate swimming. Of course our strength must soon have been
exhausted, and the mighty green waves must have swept us to destruction,
had not a barrel, thrown out from the ship, been happily floating near
us!</p>

<p>Whiskerandos saw this little island of hope. As for me, I was too
much frightened and confused to look around me; but I instinctively
followed where he led, and soon found myself, shivering, shaking,
dripping with wet, and looking as wretched as a rat can look, on the
floating barrel beside my friend!</p>

<p>How we shook our glistening sides, and shuddered and gazed
disconsolately round us on the wide waste of waters, lashed into long
streaks of angry foam! Alas! there was no land in sight; but then the
white mist rested on the horizon, which shut out the distant view.</p>

<p>“If we are not drowned we shall be starved!” exclaimed&nbsp;I, very
piteously, to Whiskerandos. Alas! our barrel was empty.</p>

<p>Oh! the misery endured that day, and the terrible night which
succeeded! We had no resource but to gnaw at the tasteless wood. We were
surrounded with water, yet perishing
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
with thirst! pinched by hunger, without hope of relief! Better to have
been drowned at once; better to have fallen by the paw of a mouser, or
to have been caught like my brothers in a trap, than to be dying thus by
inches on a barrel, tossed in the midst of the sea!</p>

<p>But with the gray morning hope dawned! We perceived that our little
island had drifted near to some shore. The waves were now much more
quiet, and leapt on the beach with a pleasant murmur, and strove to roll
on, each farther than the other, like children merrily racing
together.</p>

<p>“Could we not swim to the shore?” said Whiskerandos.</p>

<p>But I recoiled from the dangerous attempt. “No, no; some wave will
roll the barrel on the beach,” I replied; “no more struggling in the
water for me!”</p>

<p>And the waves, bearing the barrel on their green backs, seemed often
ready to land it safely on shore, but each time changed their minds, and
kept it bobbing up and down, while they retired back with a grating
noise over the pebbles, as if mocking our distress and impatience.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<p>“We are farther off now than we were ten minutes ago,” said
Whiskerandos. “Perhaps the tide is on the turn. Pluck up a brave heart,
and let’s dash in like rats!” and he plunged fearlessly into the
water.</p>

<p>But for the sharp spur of hunger, I fear that I should have left him
to make the bold attempt alone; but, famished as I was, I resolved to
swim for my life. With a sudden effort I sprang into the waves; and so,
following in the wake of my companion, I struggled in safety to the
shore!</p>

<p>Oh! the delight of feeling dry ground again!&mdash;of standing once
more on the firm, solid earth! Never, never again, I firmly resolved,
would I venture in any vessel, or trust my life to the mercy of the
billows that had so nearly accomplished our destruction.</p>

CHAPTER XX.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">CATCH HIM&mdash;DEAD OR ALIVE!</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> made a hasty breakfast off a
star-fish that we found stranded on the beach; but this rather increased
our painful thirst, and to find
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
some means of quenching it we hurried inland at the utmost speed which
our weakened powers could command. We had not run far before we came to
a large house.</p>

<p>“There is sure to be a supply of water here,” said Whiskerandos. “Let
us explore the place.”</p>

<p>“I fancy that I hear a dripping!” I cried eagerly, as we approached
the door of the back-yard.</p>

<p>The door was indeed closed, and sharp bits of broken bottles, on the
top both of it and the brick wall, rendered it impossible to climb over
them; but&nbsp;I&mdash;my wit quickened by my painful
thirst&mdash;discovered in a moment that, at the bottom of the door,
part of the wood had been broken away, either by time or perhaps the
teeth of our brethren, leaving an opening just large enough for a rat
easily to creep through.</p>

<p>I was not one to venture on an unexplored region, so I looked
anxiously through into the yard.</p>

<p>At the opposite side of it there was&mdash;oh, joyful sight!&mdash;a
pump, from which drop by drop fell, with a most inviting sound, into a
trough below. And yet, faint with thirst as
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
I was, the place had an aspect which alarmed me, and made me fear to
venture across the yard. Not far from the pump, and between it and us,
was an open green door, which led into a garden or pleasure-ground, and
though I could see nothing to alarm me, my quick ear distinguished
suspicious sounds in that direction.</p>

<p>“In with you!” exclaimed Whiskerandos, impatiently. “Don’t keep me
here, dying with thirst at the hole.”</p>

<p>I drew back with a gesture of caution. “Whiskerandos,” said&nbsp;I,
“I&nbsp;don’t like the green door open yonder. If any one came through
it into the yard and cut off our retreat!”</p>

<p>“Nothing dare, nothing win!” he exclaimed; “I am thirsty and I must
have water:” and, hurrying through the little opening which I have
mentioned, he was soon eagerly drinking at the trough.</p>

<p>Hesitating, doubting, I was about to follow him, and already my nose
was through the hole, when a sight, at the remembrance of which I
shudder still, made me withdraw it instanter. Through the fatal green
door near
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
the pump, a young man, with his hands in his pockets and his cap cocked
on one side, followed by several dogs, leisurely sauntered into the
yard.</p>

<p>I saw in an instant that for Whiskerandos escape was impossible. He
had the whole length of the yard to cross; his foes were far nearer to
him than me. His only chance was that of not being perceived; but this
in broad daylight, with the noses of three or four dogs not two yards
from him, was a miserable chance indeed. The dogs instantly found him
out, and were at him in a moment. My unhappy companion darted behind the
trough, quick as a flash of lightning. I felt assured that he would
there bravely defend himself to the last; but what could one poor rat
do, albeit the boldest of his race, against such terrible odds!</p>

<p>“Ha! a rat!” exclaimed the young man, looking quite amused and
pleased&mdash;barbarian that he was!&mdash;at the prospect of seeing a
poor defenceless creature torn to pieces before him. “Ha! Carlo, give it
him!&mdash;shake him by the ear!” The young man actually laughed aloud
with delight!</p>

<p>I could not see Whiskerandos, for the trough
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
was between us: I fancied his look of fierce despair as he faced the
foes from whom he could not flee, and from whom he could expect no pity.
He had evidently got into some corner, from which the dogs could not
easily dislodge him; for they stood yelping and barking, showing their
white teeth, with their greedy eyes all turned to one point.</p>

<p>So the human savage came to their aid. Having taken up a stick which
happened to be lying on the ground near, while the dogs retired a step
to allow their master to give his ungenerous assistance, he pushed the
stick behind the trough, and by its means dragged poor Whiskerandos from
his last place of refuge!</p>

<p>“Ha! the fellow’s dead! I must have killed him with the stick!” cried
the young man; and stooping down he lifted up the poor rat by the tail,
and held him aloft to examine him more closely, while the dogs leapt and
barked around, eager to tear their victim limb from limb!</p>

<p>“He’s been in the wars&mdash;lost his ears!” laughed the young man,
still holding the stiffened body on high by the tail. “I’m sorry
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
I poked him with the stick; he’d have given us some sport with the
dogs!” Did ever such a heartless monster walk on two feet before!</p>

<p>“Oh! Whiskerandos! Whiskerandos!” thought I, as, almost rooted to the
spot with horror, I stood gazing on the pitiful sight. “I&nbsp;am glad
that you are dead! oh, I am glad that you are dead! bravest, noblest of
rats, they can torture you no more!”</p>

<p>The dogs showed by their impatient movements that they considered
that their master took a great deal too much time in his survey of a
lifeless rat I suspect that he only did so to tease and tantalize them,
for suddenly raising Whiskerandos still higher, to give more force to
his fling, he cried, “Now Carlo&mdash;Rover&mdash;Cæsar&mdash;who’s
first!” and swung the body away towards the door behind which I stood a
trembling, shuddering spectator!</p>

<p>But lo and behold! no sooner did the seemingly dead rat touch the
ground, than he found life, strength, and speed in a moment! The dogs
were after him like the wind, but the very force of the fling had given
him a good start, and he was through the opening under the door,
knocking me over as he pushed
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
past, almost before I could recall my scattered senses sufficiently to
understand that he was actually alive! I have some remembrance of the
young man’s exclamation of amazement as the dead rat found his feet and
disappeared,&mdash;his shout, and the yells of the disappointed
dogs,&mdash;but I recollect no more, for I heard no more. Whiskerandos
and I had a fair start, and we made the best of it, and scampered off as
rats scamper for their lives. Well for us that that door was
locked!&mdash;well for us that there were broken bits of bottles on the
top! well for us that the hole was too small for the passage of any
thing larger than a rat!</p>

<p>I do not think that we were pursued: perhaps the unlocking of the
door took our foe too much time, perhaps he did not think it worth while
to hunt down such ignoble game, or perhaps he considered (but this I
much doubt) that the cleverness which a rat had shown in making so
extraordinary an escape, entitled him to a little indulgence. But we ran
as though a whole pack of hounds were behind us; we never paused to take
breath or look behind us, till we had buried ourselves in a
corn-field.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<p>“And are you really unhurt?” I exclaimed, when we stopped at last,
panting and exhausted.</p>

<p>“Unhurt? yes!&mdash;only bruised by the fling,&mdash;it was well that
the yard was not paved with stones.”</p>

<p>“And you were really alive and had your senses while that savage was
holding you up with your head hanging down! Why, you looked as like a
dead rat as ever I saw one!”</p>

<p>“I was wide awake all the time,” said Whiskerandos, “but I knew that
it was my only chance to feign death. This has been a narrow escape,
Ratto; I was never so near being torn to pieces before, not even in my
fight with the ferret!”</p>

<p>“I’ll never go near a house in daylight again!” exclaimed&nbsp;I,
still trembling with excitement and terror. Whiskerandos appeared to
feel the effects of the fright less than I did, though his danger had
been so much greater.</p>

<p>“It is your thirst that makes you so nervous,” said he; “you have not
yet recovered from our voyage on the barrel. There seems to be a wet
ditch around this field; come and moisten your nose in the water.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<p>The relief was certainly great, and as I drank the cool liquid, I
felt my spirits revive.</p>

<p>“I wonder where we are now!” said I.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt on the subject,&mdash;we are in old England again!
The look of the house, the hedges, the fields, that young
fellow&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t speak of him!” I exclaimed, “cruel, barbarous monster that
he is!”</p>

<p>“You are too hard on him,” said Whiskerandos, in his own frank,
good-humoured manner. “He may be no worse than the rest of his species,
who think that there is no harm in being cruel to a rat. I suspect that
even your blue-eyed friend would shout with joy to see a cat worry a
mouse!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it!” I replied indignantly; “a generous and noble
heart can never take pleasure in seeing pain inflicted on a poor
defenceless creature!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but&mdash;” Whiskerandos commenced, but our conversation was
suddenly interrupted by a little squeak from the hedge close behind
us.</p>

<p>“I think that I know that voice!” exclaimed I, and I had hardly
uttered the sentence ere from the thick covert sprang the
well-remembered form of Bright-eyes!</p>




<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<h3><a name = "chapXXI" id = "chapXXI">
CHAPTER XXI.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A NEW KIND OF WATCH-DOG.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">What</span> a rubbing of noses ensued!
after all my travels and perils it was such joy to see again the face of
a friend! I had so much also to relate, (I&nbsp;have ever been a
loquacious rat,) that I almost lost breath in my long narration. I wound
up my account with a description of the last adventure of Whiskerandos,
who was now, in my eyes, ten times more a hero than before.</p>

<p>“And now that I have told you my news,” said I, “let’s hear a little
of yours. In the first place, where is old Oddity?”</p>

<p>Bright-eyes hung down his head, and drooped his long tail in a
touching and melancholy manner. Such conduct in so lively a rat showed
me at once that my last surviving brother was dead!</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” was all that I could say.</p>

<p>“Not a week after our arrival in these parts, he was caught in a
hay-rick by a farmer!” faltered Bright-eyes. “I&nbsp;saw him seized by
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
the neck, I heard his despairing cry; I could not stay to see the poor
fellow killed, and I was afraid of sharing his fate, so I made off as
fast as I could.”</p>

<p>“Poor Oddity!” sighed I very mournfully, “never was there an uglier
nor a better-hearted rat! Ah! what pleasure I vainly promised to myself
in relating to you all my adventures! I have been across the deep
waters, encountered various perils, now in danger of being cooked in a
pie, now shivering on a barrel in the ocean, and yet here am I safe and
sound after all; while you, remaining quietly in England, have
ignominiously perished in a hay-rick!”</p>

<p>Whiskerandos, who, being a brown rat, could not be expected to feel
the same regret as myself, now turned towards Bright-eyes, and asked him
how far we were from London&mdash;“For I long to be back in my old
quarters,” said he.</p>

<p>“A fortnight’s journey for a rat, should he travel by land,” replied
Bright-eyes: “we came down very comfortably in a river boat, which
carried us to within five miles of this spot.”</p>

<p>“I have had enough of water for some time,” said Whiskerandos; “and
now that the fields are full of ripe corn, and the gardens of fruit,
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
nothing so pleasant as a journey by land! What say you, friend Ratto?”
inquired he.</p>

<p>“I have no mind for a long journey either by land or by sea,” replied
I in a melancholy tone; “I’ll keep company with you for a day or two,
Whiskerandos, but I would rather not return now to London. I will settle
quietly for a time in the country near the spot where poor Oddity
died!”</p>

<p>“And you?” said Whiskerandos, turning to Bright-eyes.</p>

<p>The lively rat shook his ears with all his natural vivacity. “Pardon
me,” he cried, “but I’m of Oddity’s opinion,&mdash;heroes like Sir
Whiskerandos are the very worst travelling companions in the world! How
Ratto has escaped with his life I cannot imagine, but I shall certainly
not try the experiment of following your fortunes for an hour! I’ve no
fancy to be baked in a pie, or starved on a barrel, crushed by a drosky,
or worried by a dog, drowned in a sack, or suspended by my tail! No, no,
valiant Whiskerandos, I’m quite content to admire your courage at a
distance, but I don’t want to share your exploits, and would rather have
my ears than your fame!”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<p>And off skipped the merry little rat, before we could say a word to
stay him.</p>

<p>Whiskerandos and I, being weary enough with the adventures through
which we had passed, slept for the greater part of that day in the
field, and wandered about during the night in a not vain search for
food.</p>

<p>The next day was remarkably hot. It was the season of harvest, and we
felt the necessity of keeping quietly concealed, as many men, and women
also, were busily engaged in the fields. The heat, however, produced
thirst, and no water was near in which we could quench it.</p>

<p>“I say, Ratto,” observed Whiskerandos, “do you see yonder object,
near that sheaf, that glitters so brightly in the sun?”</p>

<p>“It is a can,” replied I, “doubtless belonging to one of the
reapers.”</p>

<p>“I should not wonder if there were a <ins class = "correction" title
= "spelling unchanged">hunch</ins> of bread and cheese beside it,” said
Whiskerandos.</p>

<p>“I should not be surprised if there were.”</p>

<p>Whiskerandos remained for a minute in silence, then said,
“I&nbsp;want to compare English beer with Russian kwas.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<p>“You are not going into the field!” I cried in alarm.</p>

<p>“I am going,&mdash;why, there is nothing to fear; there is not a
reaper near, and if there were, he would need to be a sharp fellow who
could catch a rat in an open field!”</p>

<p>So the daring fellow went on his way, and I, after peeping cautiously
on this side and that, to make sure that no human being could see us in
the stubble, hurried after my companion, being to the full as curious as
himself to make acquaintance with the contents of the can.</p>

<p>There was a bundle of something beside it, tied up in a large red
handkerchief, something of a very inviting odour. But scarcely had
Whiskerandos, who was foremost, touched the reaper’s dinner with the end
of his whiskers, when something jumped up suddenly from behind the
bundle, and the voice of a rat fiercely exclaimed,&mdash;“Keep off, or
I’ll bite you!”</p>

<p>Whiskerandos looked surprised at the unexpected defiance, but my
feelings of amazement can scarcely be conceived when I recognised,
(could it be!) the dumpy form, blunt head, and piebald skin of my lost
brother Oddity!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<p>I rushed forward with a squeak of delight! No doubt, though less
eager and excited in his manner, Oddity also was greatly pleased at
meeting with his brother again. He looked, however, suspiciously from
the handkerchief to Whiskerandos, and again desired him to “keep off,”
with a resolution of which I had never dreamed the piebald rat
capable.</p>

<p>“What is in that bundle, that you guard it so carefully?”
said&nbsp;I, after we had rubbed noses again and again, with every
expression of affection.</p>

<p>“The property of my master,” replied my brother.</p>

<p>“Master!” exclaimed both Whiskerandos and I in amazement, “who ever
heard of the master of a rat! Since when have you taken upon yourself
the office of a watch-dog, to guard what belongs to our enemy, man?”</p>

<p>“Since man first showed mercy to one of the race of Mus, since he
spared a defenceless rat when in his power. I know you, Whiskerandos, I
know you,” continued Oddity, the hairs bristling up on his back, as my
companion, either in jest or earnest, took the corner of the
handkerchief between his sharp teeth:
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
“you are reckoned a hero amongst rats, but I too can fight in defence of
what is confided to my charge; you have killed a ferret, and you may
kill me, but while I have a tooth in my jaw, or a drop of blood in my
body, you shall not touch a crumb belonging to my master!”</p>

<p>Whiskerandos would have been more than a match for three Odditys, for
the piebald one had neither his strength, nor agility, nor experience in
fighting; but the strong rat seemed at this juncture to have no
inclination to give battle to the weak one. I hope that it will be
considered no sign of cowardice on his part, that he quietly dropped the
corner of the handkerchief, and never even attempted to examine the
contents of the can.</p>

<p>Of course I was all curiosity to know every particular of my
brother’s deliverance. In his own quiet, homely way, he told me his
simple tale, keeping, however, all the time, a watchful eye upon the
bundle beside him, while Whiskerandos acted the part of a sentinel to
give me timely warning if any human being should approach so near as to
endanger our safety. I will tell the story of Oddity as nearly as I can
in his own words, I only wish that I could describe
<span class = "pagenum">153</span>
the expression of his bluff, honest face, at various parts of his
narration.</p>




<h3><a name = "chapXXII" id = "chapXXII">
CHAPTER XXII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">THE FARMER AND HIS BRIDE.</span></h3>


<p>“<span class = "firstword">I was</span> caught one evening in a
hay-rick. A swift-footed creature like you, Whiskerandos, might perhaps
have escaped, but I was never remarkable for agility or speed. I felt a
strong hand grasping me by the back of my neck, and I gave myself up for
lost.</p>

<p>“‘Well, here’s an odd creature,&mdash;a piebald rat! I take it that’s
quite a curiosity!’ cried the farmer who held me in his grasp. I
expected that he would dash me against the wall the next moment, and
then set his heel upon my poor body!</p>

<p>“‘I wonder whether Mary ever saw the like of it before,’ he
continued, examining me with attention; ‘I’ll put it in the empty
wire-cage, and try if I cannot tame it for her.’</p>

<p>“Here was a reprieve, and a most unexpected one. No one who has not
believed himself to be just on the point of being smashed, can tell
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
how glad I was when I was set loose from the farmer’s <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘terribe’">terrible</ins> <ins class =
"correction" title = "archaic form unchanged">gripe</ins>, though only
to find myself in a cage!</p>

<p>“But soon the longing for liberty came. I attempted to gnaw through
the wires, but they resisted my utmost efforts. The farmer watched me,
spoke to me, gave me food&mdash;treated me like a creature that could
feel. That man has a gentle and kindly heart! At length I grew
accustomed to my master, and to see him approach my prison with food was
the only pleasure of my life. He ventured his finger between the bars,
and I never attempted to bite it. He released me at last from my cage,
and gave me a far warmer, snugger home&mdash;in the pocket of his own
great-coat!”</p>

<p>At this point in the story Whiskerandos and I uttered expressions of
amazement.</p>

<p>“Wherever he went,” continued Oddity, “I went too. He taught me many
things altogether new to a rat. It is our nature to take what we can
get,&mdash;he taught me to see food and not to touch it! He never
suffered me to feel hungry: he conversed with me as though I were a
little companion, and never one blow did I receive from his hand, or one
kick
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
from his heel! It was not in the nature of a quadruped to be insensible
to kindness like this!”</p>

<p>“And yet you owed it all to your piebald coat!” exclaimed&nbsp;I.
“Never was beauty such an advantage to a four-footed beast as ugliness
has been to you!”</p>

<p>“I found,” pursued Oddity very quietly, “that Will Grange, my master,
was going to London, to be married to the young woman whom he had spoken
of as Mary. We travelled to the city together, I snugly sleeping, coiled
up in his pocket.”</p>

<p>“And were you given to the lady?” said Whiskerandos.</p>

<p>“I was placed before her on a table, in a quiet little back-parlour,
in which she and my master sat together. She admired my appearance.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” interrupted I, “that’s impossible, I can believe anything
but that!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, she wished to gratify my master by appearing to do so.
She praised me, and fed me from her hand, and said that such a rat she
never had seen in her life. Then I crept under my master’s chair, and
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
there very quietly remained, while he and his Mary talked over future
plans together.</p>

<p>“He told her of the various things that he had bought to make his
home more comfortable for his wife. How he had planted the garden
himself with all her favourite flowers, and twined honeysuckle over his
porch. Then he took her hand within his own, and in a lower and softer
voice asked her if she were happy.</p>

<p>“‘Very happy,’ she replied, looking on the ground, while her cheek
grew like a cloud at sunrise; ‘only I cannot help feeling
sorry,’&mdash;her voice trembled a little as she spoke,&mdash;‘sorry to
leave father, and home, and the dear children in the ragged school whom
I have taught so long!’ I fancy,” continued my brother, “that something
like a dewdrop glistened on her lashes.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Mary,’ said the farmer heartily, ‘father will come and see
us; and as for your old home, why, you get a new one in exchange, and
fair exchange is no robbery, you know. Then for your ragged children,
why, I’m wanting an active, steady boy on my farm, and though I’ve no
great fancy for your pale-faced Londoners, yet if you know any
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
really good one, we’ll take him down with us into Kent.’</p>

<p>“You should have seen how much pleased the young teacher looked! She
knew one, she said, a poor motherless boy,&mdash;she would be so glad to
give him a helping hand. He was one of the best boys in the
school,&mdash;she would trust him in a room full of gold!</p>

<p>“So it was agreed between them that she should speak to the lad, and
tell him to call in the evening.</p>

<p>“In the evening he accordingly came. I had again taken my place under
the farmer’s chair, and was just falling into a doze, when I was roused
by a gentle knock at the door. Mary’s cheerful ‘Come in!’ was followed
by the entrance of,&mdash;whom do you think?”</p>

<p>“Bob and Billy!” I exclaimed at a venture.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob and Billy!” repeated Oddity, with a look of great glee;
“I&nbsp;had never thought to have seen them again! And they were so
changed, I should scarcely have known them. Bob, in particular, looked
so much taller, and stronger, and oh! so much happier than he had done
last year! He was no more the wretched, joyless, hopeless creature,
cowering
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
in rags, one that even rats might look on with pity; he had a bright,
fearless eye, and hopeful smile; and if ever a face expressed gratitude
and affection, it was his when he looked on his gentle young
teacher!</p>

<p>“‘I beg pardon for bringing Billy,’ said he, modestly but frankly,
‘I&nbsp;was afraid to let him go home quite alone.’</p>

<p>“The farmer spoke in his kindly manner to the boy. He offered him a
place on his farm, and Bob’s eyes sparkled, and his cheek flushed with
pleasure. It was but for a minute; the brightness and the glow faded
away as he glanced down at his little lame brother. I saw that Billy was
squeezing his hand,&mdash;that squeeze served all the purpose of
words.</p>

<p>“‘Thank ’ee, sir,’ said the boy, glancing first at the farmer, then
at his teacher, ‘but I think as how&mdash;I should
rather&mdash;leastways I had better stay and earn my bread here in
Lunnon.’</p>

<p>“‘And how do you earn it?’ inquired the farmer<ins class =

<p>“‘Please, sir, I clean boots,’<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id =
"tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> answered the boy; ‘I&nbsp;am one of the
yellow brigade.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<p>“There was such a look of cheerful independence on the little
fellow’s face, that no one could have glanced at him and doubted that
his bread was honestly earned.</p>

<p>“‘And would you rather stay here and rub in blacking,’ said the
farmer, ‘than be out in the open fields? Yours is an odd taste, I take
it! Would you not rather come with us?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, sir!’ said Bob, uneasily, shifting from one foot to the other,
while Billy was squeezing his hand harder than ever, and looking half
ready to cry, as he pressed closer to his side; ‘you see I could not
leave him behind,&mdash;poor lame Billy, he’s no one to care for him but
me.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s it, is it!’ cried the farmer, clapping his knee. ‘Well,
Mary, what say you? could we take the two with us do you think? If
they’ve always been together, poor fellows, ’twould be a pity to part
them now!’</p>

<p>“Bob’s only answer was a look of pleasure and gratitude, but little
Billy almost burst into tears of delight as he exclaimed, ‘Oh, yes!
please, sir, take me too!&mdash;take me too! I’ll do
anything,&mdash;I’ll work,&mdash;I’ll make baskets for your fruit.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<p>“‘And coops for my poultry, hey? We’ll find some way of making you
useful.’ And he turned to Mary with that smile which I think that all
human beings wear when they are doing some act of kindness.</p>

<p>“I was so much pleased,” continued Oddity, “at this conclusion to the
affair, that I ran out from my place beneath the chair. Billy uttered a
cry of surprise:</p>

<p>“‘There&mdash;look! if that an’t my own pretty spotted rat!’”</p>

<p>Here I rather rudely interrupted my piebald brother. “Pretty! did he
call you pretty? well, well, I shall be obliged to think you so myself,
I suppose. Spared by a man, petted by a woman, admired by a
child,&mdash;and all for your beauty,&mdash;Oddity’s beauty!” I could
not help laughing outright at the thought.</p>

<p>“My ugliness has at least done me no harm,” he replied, with a
meekness which made me more ashamed of my rudeness than if he had fired
up at my ridicule.</p>

<p>“And so you live all together here?” said Whiskerandos; “this farmer,
his wife, the two boys, and you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we are as happy as the day is long.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<p>“Humph!” said Whiskerandos; “I should prefer my wild freedom; but it
is different, I suppose, with man. And as for you, Oddity, you were
never like other rats; you were always intended for a watch-dog. And you
really guard that can and parcel for hours, and resist the temptation to
nibble?”</p>

<p>“I am trusted,” was the simple reply.</p>

<p>“Now, Oddity,” said I, “I should much like to see you in your new
home, surrounded by all your human companions.”</p>

<p>“Yonder is my master’s house,” answered Oddity, pointing across the
field with his nose. “You have but to clamber up to the window in the
evening, and peep through the clustering roses, and you will see us all
there together.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a peep,” said Whiskerandos, “and then off to old London
again!”</p>

<p>“You must take nothing from my master’s house,” cried Oddity.</p>

<p>“Not a potato paring!” laughed our valiant companion.</p>

<p>“And now I would advise you to be off,” said my brother; “here’s my
master coming for his dinner.”</p>

<p>Away we scampered at full speed, my <ins class = "correction" title =
"hyphen invisible at page-end">light-footed</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
comrade and&nbsp;I; for well we knew what was certain to be our fate if
caught even by the kind-hearted farmer. We were only rats after all.</p>

CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">A PEEP THROUGH THE ROSES.</span></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">That</span> night, when the round harvest
moon was throwing her soft light on the earth, we climbed up the
rose-tree by the window, and, quietly pushing aside the fragrant
flowers, peeped in upon such a scene as rarely meets the eye of a
rat.</p>

<p>There was a neat little kitchen, with a sanded floor and white-washed
walls, so clean, so perfectly clean, that not even the sharp eyes of the
race of Mus could have detected a speck upon them. Rows of plates lined
the shelves on the wall, pans burnished till they shone like silver, a
framed sampler hung over the mantelpiece, and a large clock merrily
ticked behind the door. Near the wide hearth there was a table, on which
a substantial supper was spread on a cloth white as new-fallen snow.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<p>Round this table were seated the farmer, his wife, and our two old
friends, Bob and Billy, in their clean smock-frocks, with country roses
on their once sickly and sunken cheeks. One might have read Will
Grange’s character in his kind, honest face; and his wife looked like a
morning in May, all sweetness, brightness, and beauty,&mdash;such beauty
as is not merely skin-deep.</p>

<p>The farmer tapped gaily on the table, and at the signal, Oddity, whom
I had not at first perceived, clambered up to his knee, and from thence
jumped on the cloth, to be fed from his master’s hand. He made his round
of the party,&mdash;every one had something to give him; and I heard the
merry voice of Billy as he patted his favourite’s snub nose,&mdash;“He’s
a pretty little fellow! now, an’t he? I wonder what’s become of the old
blind rat that he used to lead about in the shed?”</p>

<p>“Whiskerandos,” said I, pensively, to my companion, “I&nbsp;could
almost wish myself in Oddity’s place!”</p>

<p>“So do not I,” he replied quickly, as he turned from the window. “One
rat in ten millions may be petted and trusted, and show
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
himself worthy of the trust; but our race was never intended by nature
to hold the position of lap-dogs or cats.”</p>

<p>“And are we always to be hated by the lords of creation, never to be
useful to man?”</p>

<p>“We are useful to man,” said my companion.</p>

<p>“Ah! in those places where he bakes us in pies, or makes hats or
glove-thumbs of our poor skins. But in London&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When you join me in London I will show you, friend Ratto, how, by
acting the part of a scavenger, and clearing away that which, if left,
would poison the air, the race of Mus does good service to man.”</p>

<p>“Little man thanks us for it!” cried I.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob,” said the farmer, as he leant back in his chair, and
watched, with an air of amusement, his piebald favourite nibbling at a
nut, “is it true what my good wife here tells me, that the post this
morning actually brought a letter for you?”</p>

<p>“From Master Neddy,” exclaimed Bob, with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“He’s come back from Russy, and so has his father, and they’re so
glad to be in old
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
England again,” cried Billy, as in old times the most ready to speak.
“The letter was sent first to the school,&mdash;the dear old
school!&mdash;for they warn’t to know that missus was married, and we so
snug down here in the country. Oh! won’t they be pleased to hear it? And
is it not good in them, after all their travels, not to forget poor boys
like us? Do you know, there was money in the letter?” he added, lowering
his voice.</p>

<p>“Ah! Captain Blake did you some good turn, did he not?” said the
farmer to Bob.</p>

<p>“He saved me from&mdash;” the boy coloured and paused,&mdash;</p>

<p>“From want, I suppose,” said Grange, ending his sentence for him, and
stroking back Oddity’s sleek ears.</p>

<p>“From worse,” said Bob, looking down.</p>

<p>“Not from death?”</p>

<p>“Worse than that,” murmured the boy.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said the farmer, in surprise.</p>

<p>“But for him what should I have been now! Oh sir!” cried Bob,
suddenly raising his eyes, “I’ve often thought I should have told you
this before,&mdash;before you took me in here,&mdash;me and my brother
too,&mdash;and treated us so
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
kindly, and trusted us and all. You should have known what I was before
that day when Captain Blake&mdash;bless him for it!&mdash;first took me
into a ragged school.”</p>

<p>“My business is with what you are, not what you were,” said the
farmer, kindly; but Bob did not seem to hear the interruption, for he
continued, in an agitated voice, the tears rising into and then
overflowing his eyes:&mdash;“He found me a poor, ignorant, miserable
creature, not knowing so much as that it was a sin to take what was not
my own. He found me with no comfort and no hope, going on the broad way
which leads to the prison and the gallows; and worse,&mdash;worse
beyond,&mdash;I know that now. He found me a wretched thief, and he did
not hate me, despise me, despair of me: he gave me a chance, he gave me
a friend! Blessings on him!&mdash;he saved me from ruin!”</p>

<p>Here let me drop the curtain, here let me close my tale. These are
feelings, these are scenes, into which higher beings alone can enter;
they are too solemn for a story like mine.</p>

<p>And here I and my companions divide;&mdash;I
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
to luxuriate for awhile in the plenty with which rich autumn crowns the
fields around; my bold comrade to return to the city, and there, in new
adventures, to display a sagacity and courage which even the lords of
the creation would admire if belonging to any race but ours; Oddity, in
the happy home of his kind master, remains to share the board and the
hearth,&mdash;an instance that even a rat can show fidelity to man,
where man can show mercy to a rat!</p>

<p>Perhaps the human race would despise us less proudly, and persecute
us less severely,&mdash;perhaps even boys would take less pleasure in
torturing, worrying, and hunting us down,&mdash;if our characters and
instincts were better known. Who can say that some truth may not be
learned, some lesson of kindliness gained, even from a narration simple
as mine,&mdash;the history of</p>

<p>At the time this book was written, rats were classified as <i>Mus
rattus</i> and <i>Mus norvegicus</i>. The genus <i>Rattus</i> did not
become standardized until the 20th century.</p>

<h5>“The Family of Mus”</h5>

<p>By some classifications, all the animals that appear in <a href =
"#chapVII">Chapter VII</a> are part of the superfamily <i>Muroidea</i>
within the rodent family.</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>German Hamster: <i>Cricetus cricetus</i>, the black-bellied
hamster.<br>
The European hamster is at least twice the size of the Syrian
or golden hamster. Its personality is much as described.</p>
